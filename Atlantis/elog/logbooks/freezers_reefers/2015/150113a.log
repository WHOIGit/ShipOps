========================================
<p>The minimum set point for the walk-in refer is 35F.</p>
<p>The maximum set point for the walk-in refer is 50F.</p>
<p>Normal/max efficiency set point is 40F, If a very *stable* temperature environment is required, we cannot provide this at set points near the max of 50F. The closer to 50F, the greater the oscillations in temperature around the set point due to infrequent compressor cycling.</p>
<p>Normal walk-in freezer set point is 5F. Set point can be anywhere several degrees on either side. Freezer goes through 4 defrost cycles each day where temperature is 10-15 degrees higher for 20 minutes or so. </p>
