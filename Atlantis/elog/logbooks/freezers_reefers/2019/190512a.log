<p><strong>Household refrigerator/freezer models not cooling</strong></p>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Electrical</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>A basic check that the fridge is plugged in and getting adequate power (multimeter readings on the outlet and check that the breaker is closed).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Door Seal</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Run your hand around the door gasket and feel for excess air. Put a piece of paper between the door and the fridge, close the door and then pull. If the paper slips out easily, the gasket may need replacing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Condenser coils and fan</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Check the condenser coils at the back righthand side of the unit and see if they need vacuuming as clogged coils can cause poor cooling. Check to make sure nothing is stuck in the condenser fan and that it spins freely. To do this, unplug the fridge and pull it out. Clean the fan blades and spin the fan by hand to see if it&rsquo;s stuck. Plug in the fridge and make sure the fan runs when the compressor is running.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Evaporator coils and fan</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If you can hear the compressor running but the fridge isn&rsquo;t cooling, the problem is most likely either frost-clogged evaporator coils or a stuck or broken evaporator fan. Evaporator fans often squeal or chirp when they start to go bad. You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s the evaporator fan if the noise gets louder when you open the freezer door. The evaporator coils and fan are located behind the removable back cover in the freezer compartment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Temperature control</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>When the evaporator fan runs in the freezer section, it means the defrost timer and the cold control in the refrigerator are both set to COOL. Listen for the compressor motor (hermetically sealed on the rear bottom left). Most of the time, when the freezer fan is operating, the compressor should also be working. If one of the fans is not working or the compressor is off, there is likely a temperature control issue.</p>

<p>You can also toggle the temperature switch to a warmer setting and make sure that the compressor cycles off. If not, then the temperature control mechanism is a likely culprit as well.</p>
