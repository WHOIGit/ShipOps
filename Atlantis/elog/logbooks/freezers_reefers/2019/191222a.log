========================================
<p>During at42-20 it was noticed that the Cospolich -20 freezer door was sweating profusely. The unit was still able to keep temperature, air flow was not impeded inside&nbsp;the unit, the condenser fins were cleaned, and the door heater circuit was tested for continuity and voltage and checked out.</p>

<p>When inspecting around the door gasket, some leakby was felt and the gasket itself looked to be in bad shape (photos attached). A new gasket was ordered and put in place with extra sealant run around the door insulation where water had previously seaped in as well as along the inner flap of the new gasket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the door heater coil located under the grey vinyl panels at the interior entrance was checked for heat output using an IR thermometer and by hand :). The average was about 88-90 degrees F throughout the perimeter.</p>

<p>It is still sweating some, but not nearly as much as on the previous cruise and temperature remains constant.</p>
