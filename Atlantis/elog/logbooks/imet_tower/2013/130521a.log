========================================
<p>Water has been getting into the lower MET tower box, for reasons that remain unclear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The water got high enough inside the box to get inside of one of the cable that goes to the top of the tower, causing some corrosion of that cables shields.&nbsp; (which are not used.)</p>
<p>Replaced the lower box and both cables going up the mast.&nbsp; Rewired both top and bottom boxes, wiring is changed from old setup, which was sort of half baked system anyway.&nbsp; (originally, the 485 legs were to run from the bottom of the tower to the top, with a separate two wire leg for each instrument.&nbsp; Apparently this did not work,&nbsp; and was changed some time ago to have the 485 loop go to the top of the mast.)&nbsp; Basically, it's wired up the same as it was just prior, but a lot of extraneous junk has been removed and the wiring has been neatened up.&nbsp; The drawings are in Betsy's hands, waiting for completion.&nbsp; Cables and air sensing tubes were re-attached to the tower, some work was also done on insulating stainless stuff from the aluminium tower.&nbsp; The lowest section of the tower was painted sometime in the past, this appears to be actually causing corrosion.&nbsp; Probably should not paint anodized aluminium.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also removed all of the out of calibration IMET sensors, made a new mount for one of the Vaisalsa WXT520's, moved the WXT520's as far outboard as possible and relocated the SWR/LWR sensor slightly.&nbsp; </p>
