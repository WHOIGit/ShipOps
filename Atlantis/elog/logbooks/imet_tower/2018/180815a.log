========================================
<p>Replaced the tang on the bow with new stainless steel one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Work was done by WHOI shop.&nbsp; (note, after running numbers on the old tang, found out it was aproaching failure.)&nbsp; New tang meets 5:1 safety levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Removed the old headstay and replaced it with 1/2&quot; trawl chain.&nbsp; This chain has a working load of 9,000lbs.&nbsp; (common 1/2&quot; chain is only good to 6,000lbs.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Lowered the tower with no issues, however, the attachment point at the tower should be evaluated.&nbsp; Also, still using a 5/8&quot; shackle at the top, this is only rated to 7,150lbs.</p>
