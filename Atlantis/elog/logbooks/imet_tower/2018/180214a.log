========================================
<p>The port Vaisala stopped working:</p>

<p>2/11/2018 ~ 22:30 GMT - 2/12/2018 00:30 GMT - came back on its own without a power cycle</p>

<p>2/13/2018&nbsp; ~ 20:00 GMT - 23:45 GMT&nbsp; - not sure if Joe had to power cycle to get back</p>

<p>2/15/2018 22:00 GMT - 2/16/2018 01:30 GMT - again, not sure if Joe might have cycled the power</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
