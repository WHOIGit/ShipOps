========================================
<p>Sebestian Bigorre (Ch Sci OOI at39-03)&nbsp; felt that our longwave radiation sensor might be reading low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During AT3903 we have compared data from the surface mooring SUMO3 and R/V Atlantis. Instrumentation on SUMO3 was calibrated prior to deployment of the mooring in November 2017. The SUMO3 buoy contains the regular suite of instruments (air temp/humidity, pressure, precip, longwave, shortwave, wind) at a height of about 5 m above the air-sea interface. The comparison was done by adjusting heights of Atlantis sensors (20.6 m AWL) using a bulk algorithm (COARE3).</p>

<p>Based on this comparison, there is a good chance your longwave sensor is about 15 W/m**2 low. All other measurements agreed quite well between ship and buoy. See plots attached below wrt LWR.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, it might be a good idea to get that calibrated when possible!&nbsp; The last calibration was 25 June 2015.</p>

<p>I did a dump of the values in the sensor on 2018-Feb-02:</p>

<p>The only values that seemed questionable were:</p>

<p>&gt; &gt; I attached the dump I did rad_2018feb02.txt (I could not figure out how to do the configuration dump they talked about in the manual, but<br />
&gt; &gt; mine does include the values of interest). &nbsp;I also attached the calibration sheets we received. &nbsp;If this is the correct calibration sheet<br />
&gt; &gt; then I think everything looks okay in the sensors except for:<br />
&gt; &gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; &gt; -----RAD CALIBRATION DATA---------------------------------<br />
&gt; &gt; &#39;g&#39; --&gt;Set PSP amplifier gain value. (118.8)<br />
&gt; &gt; &#39;o&#39; --&gt;Set PSP amplifier offset, mv. (0.8 mv)<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>However - these are associated witht eh shortward radiation sensor.&nbsp; So, they do not seem relevant to the problem (other than not seeming to match up with the calibration sheet - see graphs, not initial numerical values - the calibration sheet is confusing, but seems to contain both actual and standard type values for the sensor).</p>
