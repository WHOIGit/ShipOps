========================================
<p>Vaisala C2140003 (starboard) installed in July 2021 was found to have multiple issues:</p>

<p>-Data port on the unit is non-functional. Can only talk to the unit through the USB configuration port.</p>

<p>-New PTU put inside the unit, T1820378, was also bad and did not output data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>New WXT536 s/n T4150412 with PTU T4020335 was installed in its place on 21 Oct 2021.</p>

<p>LWR had been giving erroneous data since leaving Anacortes in July 2021.</p>

<p>Problem was traced to a bad cable between the RAD and LWR....data changed when cable was wiggled. Cable changed and problem has not reoccured.</p>
