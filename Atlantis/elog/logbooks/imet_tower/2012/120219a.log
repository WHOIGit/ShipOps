========================================
<p>While tracing the problem for one of the Vaisala WXT520s, found out that the lower box on the MET tower had about 2&quot; of water in it.</p>
<p>Opened the box and blasted it with water from a garden hose and cleaned with a wire (brass) brush.&nbsp; The aluminum plate has some significant corrosion on it,&nbsp; although it does not need any repair.&nbsp; One terminal fell off, a few other probably need to be replaced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not clear how the water is getting in the box.</p>
<p>UPDATE, Feb 21:&nbsp; Sealed the lower box with electrical tape.&nbsp; If we again find the box full of water, we need to see where it's coming from.&nbsp; Also need to follow up and change out some of the terminal strips.&nbsp;</p>

========================================
<p>Installed new&nbsp; aluminum mount for new swr/lwr combo box.&nbsp; Probably not in the best location yet, the entire top of the tower should be rearranged to optimize lack of shadows for light sensors and better placement for wind sensors.&nbsp; Also could get the parts anodized.&nbsp;</p>
