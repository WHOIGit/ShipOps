========================================
<p>Installed new&nbsp; swr/lwr combo box.&nbsp; Probably not in the best location yet.&nbsp; Added LWR to calliope.&nbsp; Note, had to change terminator from \003 to \010.&nbsp; Also had to change the timeout on LWR to about 2.5 seconds. (LWR response is very slow.)</p>
