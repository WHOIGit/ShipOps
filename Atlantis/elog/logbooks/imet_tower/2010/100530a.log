========================================
<p>The Port Vaisala stopped outputting data at 7:51 GMT on 5/29/10.&nbsp; It was noticed&nbsp; and the athena computer was reboot and the Calliope system restarted at 14:41 GMT 5/29/10.&nbsp; This has happened before.&nbsp; Attempts were made to reinitialize the sensor, but it did nto respond until the system was reboot.&nbsp; During the SD port stop just prior to this cruise, the tower was lowered.&nbsp; I removed and examined the port Vaisala sensor.&nbsp; There was no apparent damage/corrosion.&nbsp; The sensor has been functioning fine most of the time.</p>
