<p>
<pre>
10/14/10 @ 17:02 GMT - Starboard Vaisala sensor  stopped collecting data
10/14/10 @ 10:45 GMT - IMET sensors stop reporting data
10/15/10 @ 15:59 GMT - Athena computer reboot and Starboard Vaisala and IMET
		       sensors begin reporting data again (previous attempts
 		       to simply reinitialize sensors may have caused the IMET
                       to stop reporting)</pre>
