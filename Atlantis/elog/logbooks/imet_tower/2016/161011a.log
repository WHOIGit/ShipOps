========================================
<p>During AT37-03 RAD/LWR sensor 223 began showing erroneous (very high) dome temperature values, which in turn threw off the calculated LWR values.</p>
<p>During port stop between AT37-03 and AT37-04 the met tower was lowered.&nbsp; Nothing immediately found wrong with RAD/LWR. 12V power to the imet tower was secured and the upper met tower jbox opened. The box had a fair amount of water inside, so box was cleaned and dried. Sensor 223 continued to operate normally after this for several days. When RAD/LWR 224 arrived it was installed and operated normally, however after a short time it also began showing erroneous dome temp and LWR values. A brief (~15 second) power cycle did not fix the issue, however a longer (~1 hour) power cycle did. The sensor has continued to operate normally for several days follwing this long power cycle, leading to a hypothesis that there may not be anything wrong with either sensor, and we are just experiencing some kind of data clobbering.</p>
