========================================
<p>The LTO decks from the main lab station that have never been used were removed by Scotty 25 Feb 17 to make room for the new storage device. We are retaining one on board (with cables) as a spare for the computer lab station. It is stored in the sssg closet. Scotty is bringing the other back to WHOI.&nbsp; </p>
