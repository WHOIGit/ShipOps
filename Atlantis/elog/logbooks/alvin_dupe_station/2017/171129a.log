========================================
<p><span style="font-size:16px">I boot the Alvindata02 computer and got an error:</span></p>

<p><big><span style="font-size:16px">&quot;<strong><span class="marker">The system is running in low-graphics mode.</span></strong></span></big></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Your screen, graphics card and input device settings could not be detected correctly.&nbsp; You will need to configure these yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Well - at first I could not even read the second part of the error, because it was miniscule on the screen, I could barely make out the first line.&nbsp; I attached a different monitor mous</span>e and keyboard, and then I could at least read the message.&nbsp; I tried stepping through the options but there weren&#39;t many.&nbsp; I did a google search, most of the fixes had to do with updates having been made, etc.&nbsp; I happened to read a side note someone wrote that they had discovered their hard drive was full after seeing this message.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">I did the following:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">reboot untl message came up</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Ctrl-Alt-F1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then logged in</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">df -h</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">sure enough, sda2 was 100% full.&nbsp; I deleted a bunch of directories from the alvin data that had been archived.&nbsp; Then the system boot fine.</span></p>
