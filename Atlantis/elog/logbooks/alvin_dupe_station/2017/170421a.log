========================================
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I wrote a script called sort_ext_stills.sh.&nbsp; It will take all the jpgs in a directory and sort them by what year, month, day and time is embedded in the picture.&nbsp; It also renames them by date and time.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">To use it, just take all the pictures and put them in one directory.&nbsp; Run sort_ext_stills.sh.&nbsp; It will sort them into their hourly directories.&nbsp; Then you'll need to run dsth in each directory to make the thumbnails and index.html page.&nbsp; This is the first iteration of the script.&nbsp; The next one will do the dsth automatically and then make an upper level index page so you can browse the pictures from the top level.</span></p>
