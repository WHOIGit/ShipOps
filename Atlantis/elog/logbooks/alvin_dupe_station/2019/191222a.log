========================================
<p>While performing the &quot;Beginning of the Cruise&quot; tasks on the AlvinDataNVideo.docx, it was noticed that 1B3823 and 1B3824 could not talk with each other or any of the Main Lab computers.&nbsp; After some troubleshooting, it was determined that the Niagara Switch in the computer was not passing signal at all and needed to be replaced.&nbsp; The computer lab Niagara switch was taken out for further investigation and is awaiting a full diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Niagara switch from the Main Lab was brought over to the Computer Lab and now there are Netgear switches in the Main Lab where that Niagara used to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The speed of data transfer within the Computer Lab was prioritized in this case, and copying from the Computer Lab to the Main Lab now takes much longer than it used to since it is now hooked up via Ethernet to a 1gbps Netgear Switch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A diagram of the current setup is attached to this entry,</p>
