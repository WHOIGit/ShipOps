========================================
<p>I was in the middle of copying all of the 4k footage from its D:/ Drive to an external Transcend drive, and at the same time I was copying all Original_Video from Z:/ to D:/ (this is after the Wrangler93 process).&nbsp; I was copying the Original_Video from 1B3824&nbsp;to a &quot;Temp&quot; folder on 1B3823 because I wanted to have the &quot;processed&quot; Original Video on the 23 computer so I could put that computer&nbsp;to use copying the &quot;processed&quot; Original Video to the transcend external hard drive.&nbsp; The point of this exercise was to free up CPU/RAM on the 24 computer since it was still copying the previous day&#39;s footage to the Synology (over&nbsp;ethernet since the Niagara died) and doing the transcode process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I figured that copying Original Video from 24 to 23 would take ~30mins and then copying it to the transcend would take ~2hrs which would mean that I could sneakernet it over to the Synology and leave it copying to that overnight.&nbsp; That way when Emily woke up, all but the Proxy videos would be copied to where it needed to be.&nbsp; ...Still trying to fine-tune this process.&nbsp; I expect there will be more updates on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The BSOD instructed me to just restart the computer, so that&#39;s what I did.&nbsp; Assuming video that was being copied at the time of BSOD, I deleted all of the &quot;half-copied&quot; videos and started over.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ll keep an eye on it and do these transfers one at a time now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
