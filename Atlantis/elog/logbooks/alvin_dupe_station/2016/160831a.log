========================================
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">A temporary fo cable was run between the computer lab duping station and the main lab duping station</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">to see if that would speed things up.&nbsp; Apparently, the download speed is still limited by other equipment -</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">primarily the speed of the video computers themselves (1GB).&nbsp; Right now it is better for science to plug </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">into the switch with their RAID arrays than to go via the computers.</span></p>

<p>EMAIL INFORMATION FROM SCOTTY&nbsp; - 20 Jun 2016</p>
<p>&gt; &gt; Hi guys. Sorry to be late weighing in. In addition to my usual duties I'm standing<br />
&gt; &gt; two 4 hour watches to cover someone lost to illness.<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Some gory details...<br />
&gt; &gt; When Jon purchased the equipment in the comp lab rack it came with 1 meter length<br />
&gt; &gt; 10Gb SFP+ cables. When I set up the comp lab rack I bought others one meter<br />
&gt; &gt; longer, to provide more flexibility of where to place the switches. Adding the extra<br />
&gt; &gt; meter caused comms to fail. I ended up installing the switches in a somewhat awkward<br />
&gt; &gt; place in order to use the original cables. These were copper-based cables.<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; So, we know that there's quite a bit of sensitivity to cable length. I also didn't<br />
&gt; &gt; have the experience of using FO-based. I don't know whether these switches will accept<br />
&gt; &gt; a FO-based cable directly or whether some fiber&lt;-&gt;copper conversion is required.<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Regarding available ports, I believe this is the situation:<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Comp lab:<br />
&gt; &gt; 4 10 Gb ports available<br />
&gt; &gt; 2 10Gb ports to interconnect the two Wrangler Rack computers.<br />
&gt; &gt; 1 10Gb port to connect to main lab by FO<br />
&gt; &gt; 1 port for router (provides DHCP and isolation from ship network?)<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Main lab expected:<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Same 4 10 Gb ports available<br />
&gt; &gt; 1 10Gb port back to comp lab by FO<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; 2(3) 1Gb ports for MacPros(iMac)<br />
&gt; &gt; 1 1Gb for local NAS</p>

&gt; OK Scotty. Looks like you can do this easily, assuming we have or get<br />
&gt; the parts of course. The four 10G interfaces are all SFP+. So you can<br />
&gt; plug any SFP+ module into these (assuming the vendor allow it). You can<br />
&gt; put the Cu SFP+ aside. No need for media conversion.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; I'm not in my office today but I will check tomorrow to see if I have a<br />
&gt; couple of spare 10GBASE-SR SFP+ modules. If not, they are readily<br />
&gt; available, and pretty cheap, on ebay. It sounds like you will also need<br />
&gt; a couple of multi-mode ST-LC cables. I'll check to see if we have any of<br />
&gt; these. It's likely we do but I don't know if they will be long enough.<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since it's a Cu SFP+ module, you should be able to remove that SFP+ and<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; replace it with whatever type you need. The link you sent is for the<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; MM/SR SFP+ that would replace the Cu SFP+. I may have a spare one of these.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to be sure, are you sure that it is a Cu SFP+ module and not just<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; an RJ45 connection? Can you remove the Cu SFP+? It should look very<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; similar to the module in the link you sent.<br />
&gt;&gt; The switches are Interface Masters Niagara 2904-24TG. They have 24 RJ45 1Gb ports and<br />
&gt;&gt; 4 10Gb SFP+ ports. These were purchased second half of 2012. One has been in use,<br />
&gt;&gt; the other a spare. The spare is now being put into service to talk to the primary.<br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt; I looked at the manual a few days ago and I gleaned (incorrectly perhaps, hoping not)<br />
&gt;&gt; that the SFP+ ports expect an electronic signal.<br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt; The primary already has two computers attached via 1m cables with SFP+ on both ends.<br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt; The idea is to run a jumper from a 3rd port on primary to a patch panel, use a previously<br />
&gt;&gt; installed multimode fiber to another patch panel, run a jumper from the patch panel to<br />
&gt;&gt; a 10Gb port on the spare.<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for chiming in. Could you elaborate a bit more on <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the switch accepts a Cu SFP+ then it should also accept a fiber SFP+<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (MM/SR or SM/LR). Fiber SFP+s are all LC connections, I believe. I<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As in, does that mean a fiber SFP+ doesn&rsquo;t require conversion to copper SFP+?<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would think that some sort of photon to electron conversion has to happen.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [As I said, pretty inexperienced in this realm.]<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />

It&rsquo;s conceivable that the fiber winds all over the place and sums to 220m, but I&rsquo;ll guess that&rsquo;s likely to be quite a<br />
bit<br />
less.<br />
<br />
In terms of physical layout it&rsquo;d be better to use the currently installed fiber if it&rsquo;ll work, and I therefore think<br />
it should be<br />
assessed. Does Matt have the time to do this?<br />
<br />
John, do the termination issues you mention stem from a mismatch between a 50/125 patch cable or something else?<br />
[I do not know the internal structure of the patch panels. Might they have some sort of size matching?]<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />

&gt; That's not true. 10G definitely runs over 62.5. Not very far admittedly: 220M. This should work for Scotty. There<br />
may be some termination issues. <br />

&gt;&gt; He tells me that the installed multimode on the Atlantis is OM1 (62.5<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Scotty<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; The fiber on Atlantis was installed when the ship was built.&nbsp; All of<br />
&gt;&gt; it was not used for many years.&nbsp; Some of it has recently been put into<br />
&gt;&gt; service, but most of it remains unused and untested.&nbsp; I believe that<br />
&gt;&gt; there was some testing done quite a few years ago, some of it was good,<br />
&gt;&gt; and some were not.&nbsp; I was told at one time that it was all junk, but<br />
&gt;&gt; that may have been based on the type of fiber, not it's condition. <br />
&gt;&gt; Since a few are in use now, I guess it's not total junk.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Robbie<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this means that some sort of test should be performed to make<br />
&gt;&gt; sure that what&rsquo;s in the ship will support<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10Gb from patch panel to patch panel. I&rsquo;m supposing that this same<br />
&gt;&gt; test will also tell us whether 50/125 OM3<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; patch cords will suffice. They&rsquo;d be 15m lengths at each end from<br />
&gt;&gt; patch panels to racks.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&rsquo;ll be in a meeting this morning and I&rsquo;m hoping that Matt can<br />
&gt;&gt; schedule such a test with me later this afternoon or<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; tomorrow morning.<br />

Guess I should have anticipated that y&rsquo;all would proactively look for answers, and I should have looked later in my<br />
mail queue.<br />
<br />
Based on this it&rsquo;s starting to sound to me like it makes more sense to run a direct line from one rack to another.<br />
Mostly because<br />
it&rsquo;ll avoid the purchase and maintenance of several specialized products when a common product will solve the problem<br />
cleanly.<br />
Running the cable directly is a bummer amount of work, but not a non-starter.<br />

&gt; OK. John and I did some more digging..<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; In theory, you CAN use 10gbps over the lowest grade 62.5 micron FDDI<br />
&gt; optical fiber for about 220 meters with:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; 10GBASE-LRM<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; optics. You will need special &quot;mode conditioning&quot; patch cords.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; We found new 10GBASE-LRM optics on Amazon for about $150. John also<br />
&gt; found some on e-Bay for $35.<br />

of the Verification Cruise. The second was made this afternoon to show the hardware mods<br />
we discussed this morning.<br />

They can be tailored for your needs of course. I just wanted to get something to you before the<br />
