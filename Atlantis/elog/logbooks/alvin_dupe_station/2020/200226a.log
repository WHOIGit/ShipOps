========================================
<p>If Sealog (on C+C computer) ever throws out &quot;failed to connect to localhost port 8000: Connection<br />
refused&quot; errors, especially when running <strong>sealog_predive.pl, </strong>it means the sealog server is not running.</p>

<p>Point a browser on alvindata01 to http://199.92.162.100:9001 and click the &quot;start&quot; link next to the &quot;sealog_server&quot; entry, and also for any other component that is not running (indicated by red buttons on left).</p>
