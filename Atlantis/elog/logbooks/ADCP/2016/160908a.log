========================================
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">JULES MIGHT PREFER TO DO THIS HERSELF</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, if you really need to delete the ADCP data within an EEZ, this is what is required, and probably I have to do it, and it can't happen until the cruise is done<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">(which is when?) and I have time (that depends on the ship schedule).&nbsp; Then you have to back it up again (delete the original and back it up) or the EEZ data will<br />
still exist.<br />
<br />
(1) raw:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; find all the time ranges during which data need to be deleted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - determine the 2-hour files that include any of those time ranges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - delete those files (but really, you'd better let me do it or we might miscommunicate and break the dataset<br />
(2) processed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - use a tool to delete the portions of the processed data for each of the processing directories<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (looks like wh300 and os75nb)<br />
<br />
******************<br />
If you use 'find' to identify files called at2016_ddd_sssss<br />
where ddd is the decimal day (starting with 0, not 1) and sssss<br />
is seconds of the day, you will find all the raw data.<br />
<br />
You can make sure of the correspondence by typing<br />
<br />
to_day 2016 234.567<br />
<br />
or to_date 2016 2016 08 22 13 45 01<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yearbase year month day hour min sec<br />
<br />
And if you do &quot;head&quot; of the gps files you'll get the<br />
decimal day ($UNIXD,decimal-day, days-since-boot)<br />
and the GPGGA message so you can hone in that way as well.<br />
<br />
There are two copies -- /home/data and /disk2/home/data.<br />
Keep notes of what you do in one, because you'll have to<br />
do the same in the other.<br />
<br />
The database for the wh300 is /home/data/CRUISEID/proc/wh300/adcpdb/a_at*.blk<br />
and you use a tool called &quot;delblk&quot; to delete time ranges of the database.<br />
The syntax is<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /home/data/CRUISEID/proc/wh300/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delblk a_at<br />
<br />
<br />
- it has a menu (number-based); choose &quot;time range&quot;<br />
- then you have to enter something like this<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 08 28 00 00 00 to 2016 08 28 23 00 00<br />
<br />
Run it separately for each piece of data you need to delete,<br />
and for each instrument.<br />
<br />
Again, if you keep copy-paste versions of what you run in<br />
/home/data/at37_02 then you can run them again in /disk2/home/data/at37_02.<br />
<br />
