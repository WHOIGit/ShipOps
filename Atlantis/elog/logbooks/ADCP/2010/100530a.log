========================================
<p>Email from Jules (26-May-10):</p>
<p>It was recently brought to my attention that the<br />
temperature on the OS75 has been registering as<br />
zero for the last 5 days.&nbsp; This did not happen gradually,<br />
but between &quot;stop pinging&quot; and &quot;start pinging&quot;.&nbsp; As<br />
far as I know, there was no cycling of power in the<br />
interim, but the last data from the previous cruise leg shows<br />
reasonable temperatures and the first data from the present<br />
cruise leg (i.e. *as soon as pinging started*).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catie recalled the same thing happening back in Sept. of 2009.&nbsp; At that time stopping and restarting data acquisition solved the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This was done again (the deck unit was also turned off and on) and the temperature came back fine.</p>
