========================================

<p>&quot;I just saw that the OS75 transducer temp is out again (from looking at the UHDAS<br />
vector plot).<br />
<br />
Apparently this has happened before; I attach some email traffic on that below.&nbsp; In<br />
that case, toggling bottom track was related to bringing it back; perhaps simple<br />
start/stops of the acquisition do the same?<br />

<p>Shut down and re-started both computer and deck box.&nbsp; It resolved the problem.</p>
<p>Previously, cycling the bottom tracking setting solved the problem.&nbsp; I did a power reset because it had been a long time since everything had been shut down.</p>
