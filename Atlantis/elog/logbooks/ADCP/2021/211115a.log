========================================
<p>Both currents01 and currents02 were updated to Ubuntu 20.04 and the most up-to-date edition of UHDAS in September. UHDAS folks used our machines at the dock extensively as a guinea-pig install, so there are many many test cruises in currents01://home/data. All working as it should be though as of mid-Oct.</p>

<p>Also, UHDAS was throwing a lot of errors when getting its Seapath feed serially, so on 25 August I created a UDP on the Seapath to feed currents directly on UDP 55104.</p>
