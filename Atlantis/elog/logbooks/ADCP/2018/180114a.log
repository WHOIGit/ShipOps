Subject: Bias in OS75 BB Mode data

========================================
<p>Jules is seeing a bias in the OS75 BB Mode data.&nbsp; Unknown source.&nbsp; Not sure how to troubleshoot, as intermittent.&nbsp; This was also seen back in Spet 2017 during the NAAMES cruise.</p>

<p><strong>***EMAIL</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>11 Jan 2018</strong></p>

<p>Hi folks</p>

<p>It looks like we&#39;re seeing that strange &quot;bias in the deep<br />
OS75 BB mode&quot; data again.</p>

<p>see attached.</p>

<p>The orange and dark blue at the bottom are not physically reasonable and are correlated with ship direction (heading) changes, so another indication that it<br />
is not ocean velocities we are seeing, but some kind of problem.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what we can do, since it seems to be intermittent.</p>

<p>To clean up the data, we could run with OS75 narrowband only, for instance. There are some ships where we have to secure broadband mode because of this kind<br />
of error. &nbsp; It&#39;s not a bad thing -- running with OS75NB only improves the NB data by doubling the number of pings used<br />
in each averaging interval. &nbsp;The only loss is in the higher-resolution of the BB mode.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll keep watching and if it gets worse or seems to be pervasive, we might recommend running with OS75BB off, i.e. just OS75NB and the WH300.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>OK; Let&#39;s run with NB only for the forseeable future.<br />
I&#39;ll send you a plot and you can put it in the plastic folder with the cheet sheet (if you have one) or on the Desktop, to remind people of why we want BB<br />
off. &nbsp;For super-shallow water, you have the Wh300 in any case. &nbsp;We&#39;ll make a note here.</p>

<p>&quot;BB mostly works, but has intermittent periods with obvious biases<br />
in the deepest bins, possible pervading up into the middle of the data. The cause might be electrical noise but there is easy no way to troubleshoot the<br />
problem, since its occurrence is not predictable.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;ll make a change in the defaults too, so it comes up NB only.</p>

<p>Could you turn on the spare computer so we can make the change there too?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
