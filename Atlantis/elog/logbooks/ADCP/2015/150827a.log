========================================
<p>Installation completed on August 3, 2015</p>
<p>A few more bits of information.&nbsp; The 300 that we put in is the exact same one that was<br />
on the Knorr.&nbsp; I've now got the deck box plugged into the computer, (currents1).&nbsp; The<br />
deckbox is currently plugged into port 2 on the usb dongle.&nbsp; (ttyUSB1?)&nbsp; The cable to<br />
the transducer is not yet connected.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offset angle after bottom tracking calibration w/ per Jules:</p>
<p><br />
I changed the angle from 55 to 50.85 so you can<br />
do something like<br />

Hi Jules<br />
<br />
We are just finishing up the installation of a 300 workhouse ADCP on the Atlantis.&nbsp; This is a permanent installation.<br />
The ADCP has no window, is painted with bottom paint, and beam three is probably about 55 degrees to stbd.&nbsp; (55 degrees<br />
clockwise)&nbsp; We had a loaner 300 in before, maybe everything is still ready to go.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I'm just finishing up the wiring from the ADCP head to the deck box, the deck box is not powered up, (but<br />
soon will be), the Atlantis is at the dock in Woods Hole, and has a shore internet connection.<br />

I guess we're all ready to go then.<br />
I changed the angle for the WH300 to 55deg, as you suggested.<br />
<br />
Cute cruise name: &quot;docktestfor300yippee&quot;&nbsp; ha ha!<br />
<br />
So, when you go out on the upcoming cruise, put the WH300 in<br />
bottom track mode when the ship is over the shelf on its way out, and<br />
we can adjust the calibration soon after that.&nbsp; If you all can<br />
call the upcoming transit AT30_01_cal, then after we fix the<br />
calibration angle you can call the regular cruise AT30_01.<br />

Hi folks<br />
<br />
(1) WH300<br />
(2) OS75<br />
<br />
<br />
(1) WH300<br />
<br />
First of all, we can adjust the calibration of the WH300 any time.<br />
<br />
The calibration block looks like this:<br />
<br />
---------<br />
/home/adcp/cruise/proc/wh300/cal/botmtrk/btcaluv.out<br />
<br />
unedited: 410 points<br />
edited:&nbsp;&nbsp; 236 points, 2.0 min speed, 2.5 max dev<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; median&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; std<br />
amplitude&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0001&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0008&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0025<br />
phase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1389&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1460&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0790<br />
---------<br />
So the 55deg I dialed in needs to be adjusted to 55-(4.15) = 50.85<br />
<br />
<br />
I can make that change and let you know that I did,<br />
but then you need to<br />
<br />
- stop logging<br />
- end cruise (yes, sorry, end&nbsp; AT30_01 )<br />
- kill UHDAS GUI<br />
<br />
- start UHDAS GUI (so it will read the new transducer angle)<br />
- start new cruise (yes, sorry)<br />
- start recording<br />
<br />
I don't know if the next cruise was supposed to be AT30_02 or AT31<br />
but you had better make sure before naming the next segment of this<br />
cruise.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let me know if/when you want me to do this.<br />
<br />
(2) OS75<br />
<br />
The OS75 data are reading &quot;zero&quot; for temperature.&nbsp; It has done this<br />
in the past,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is Not Good.&nbsp; Let's try to get it back to normal<br />
by kicking it in the pants.&nbsp; This has worked before:<br />
- stop logging<br />
- no need to end cruise<br />
- turn off the deck unit<br />
- count to 10<br />
- turn it on<br />
- start recording<br />
<br />
Does the temperature still read zero?<br />

&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would be so kind and make the changes, I will shut everything down<br />
&gt; after that, and power cycle the OS75.&nbsp; Hopefully that will fix things.<br />

The temperature is still at 0C.<br />
<br />
We need to discuss this with RDI, but separately, I should change<br />
another setting in the code, which will require you to start another<br />
cruise name.&nbsp; Will that be OK?&nbsp; I need to hardwire the soundspeed<br />
to be 1530m/s to override the bad temperature.<br />
<br />
May I proceed?<br />
