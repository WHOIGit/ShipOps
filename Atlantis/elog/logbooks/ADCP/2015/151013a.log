Hello Jules,<br />
<br />
It could be the temperature. A chassis may not recognize the temperature sensor at startup. We have not been able to<br />
recreate this error, but we know it happens occasionally. <br />
<br />
When this behavior occurs, in the PS0 response, it will show &quot;Sensors:&nbsp; NONE&quot;. It should say &quot;Sensors:&nbsp; TEMP&quot;.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
To resolve the issue, send BREAK, PS0 once or twice. Once you see &quot;TEMP&quot;, commence sampling, and verify that the<br />
temperature is correct in the UHDAS. <br />
<br />
Do you have a representative data sample that you could share with us? If so, please upload the file using the FILEDROP<br />
link in my email signature. <br />
<br />
Thank you. I look forward to your reply. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Scott<br />

Hello again: There is a 5% error in the OS75, but it is reading TOO HIGH<br />
and needs to be divided by 1.05.<br />
<br />
The question remains though, what could cause this kind of error?<br />
Is there anything related to a ship yard&nbsp; period that would be plausible?<br />
<br />
Would it help to send a data snippet?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello RDIFS,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; Something happened to the Atlantis OS75 about 2 months ago,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; when a new WH300 was put in.&nbsp; I don't know whether the WH300<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; has anything to do with this, but the OS75 now needs a multiplier<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; of about 1.05 to get reasonable values.&nbsp; The change seems to have<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurred during that long in-port period.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you think of anything that would cause this to happen?<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; Possibly related, the temperature is reading zero.&nbsp; This has<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened before, but power-cycling the deck unit has always brought<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; the temperature back.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
