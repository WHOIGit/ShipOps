========================================
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">There were issues with the Atlantis OS75 deck box.&nbsp; The issues stemmed from the temperature sensor problem </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">(see message id#10 for information on how to see if the deck unit has found the temperature sensor) we've been seeing over the years.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Jules email below explains what she found with regard to her handling of that issue.&nbsp; The attachments demonstrate what she was seeing.<br />

<p>I think the answer is that I overcompensated for<br />
the temperature going to zero by hardwiring the soundspeed, and that<br />
causes a temperature-dependent scale factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the good news is<br />
<br />
(1) Once I put the soundspeed back to &quot;automatic&quot; the rest of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cruise should clear up<br />
(2) Craig's cruise and others in the last 3 months can all be fixed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by re-processing the data<br />
<br />
<br />
The bad news is (probably)<br />
The Atlantis deck unit NEEDS TO GO BACK and get that temperature<br />
problem fixed (or the OS75 needs to get fixed) -- I'll ask RDI<br />
if the problem is in the deck unit or the transducer.<br />
<br />
and I'll talk to Dan Torres or whoever it is that is dealing with those cruises.<br />
