========================================
<p><strong>T39-04 Transit Worklist (list started at39-02 transit)</strong></p>

<p>(Not really in any kind of order, but stuff more towards the bottom not that high priority to get done on this cruise and can easily wait)</p>

<p>- <span style="color:#FF0000">WHOI -&nbsp; </span>-70 freezer in science hold &ndash; NEED SERVICE CALL AND NEW HEATER - ground fault &ndash; burnt another plug (turns out i was door heater again).&nbsp; Was never fixed last summer.&nbsp; Heaters are still disconnected from last then.&nbsp; Emailed david 2018-jan-30 about getting service call - Phil B (engineering) looked at it.&nbsp; The heater was hooked back up.&nbsp; Some question as to whether it was a new heater or old heater.&nbsp;<span style="color:#FF0000"> Steve W. (cheng) has ordered a new heater via NS5 and put in a request for a SLO-MO (or whatever it&#39;s called) service representative to come and install - the part was handed to me (Allison) by JT, he hand carried it out.&nbsp; So, we have it here.&nbsp; Right now it is on my desk.</span></p>

<p><s>-<span style="color:#FF0000">PR DAVE IN PR - </span>NAAMES - install check valve in underway sensor system like we had on the last NAAMES cruise.&nbsp;</s></p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">PR - AFTER VAN MOVE TO O1 deck - </span>NAAMES - put chimney on radvan (it is inside right now) &ndash; can&rsquo;t put on until we know if and where it will be moved to &ndash; supposed to go to O1 deck, but inboard or outboard?fx</p>

<p><del>-<span style="color:#FF0000">END OF AT39-05 on way to PR - </span>NAAMES &ndash; zap flow thru with chlorine &ndash; Tim Bates would like the piping to the O2 deck zapped as well &ndash; open that pipe till chlorine smell comes</del></p>

<p>-<del><span style="color:#FF0000">END OF AT39-05 on way to PR - </span>NAAMES - Pre-stage if possible/time permitting ethernet runs to forward vans for NAAMES.</del></p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">AS ARRIVING IN PR - </span><span style="color:#000000">NAAMES - breakdown bench in BioLab and set up O2 titrator on other bench (breakdown aft one this time so titration not right in the way of Boss flow thru stuff)</span></p>

<p><del>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE - SET UP WITH SCIENCE GROUP - </span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; plankton nets and surface pump (where and what help do they need)? They are going on clean wire, so STBD side.&nbsp; May switch to boom instead of crane.</del><br />
-hiseasnet spectrum analyzer &ndash; can&rsquo;t tune it in.&nbsp; Something is wrong</p>

<p>-Test IPcam software (Josh) - <span style="color:#FF0000">Josh said he tried to load the software and it requires a license.&nbsp; I thought it was on a 90-day free trial, but that was in Oct 2015 :O&nbsp; I emailed panasonic and asked if we can have a 90-day trial anyway. psditech@us.panasonic.com - email I got from live chatting - granted 90 day trial, but this software requires Windows 7 not XP.</span></p>

<p>-Hiseasnet A/C maintenance</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">SAN JUAN - Dave bringing check valves.&nbsp; </span>Check valve in place of debubbler in bow thruster room - have possible check valve on my desk (allison) - maybe not quite right<span style="color:#FF0000">&nbsp; ds will bring new check valve to install in San Juan</span></p>

<p>-Make web guide for &ldquo;things to shut off in your phone/computer to not hog bandwidth&rdquo; &ndash;<span style="color:#FF0000"> 2018-Jan-20 - I posted one we got<a name="_GoBack"></a> via email about conserving bandwidth on ship website</span></p>

<p>-Figure out how to put TSS1 and separate heading feed into Sonardyne &ndash; why does heading have to be separate from attitude (is it just a matter of speed of receiving) &ndash; problem is actually that the phins port with heading is tied to 4800 baud due to GPS 1850 coming in there - <span style="color:#FF0000">can we get rid of GPS2 in phins?</span></p>

<p>-See about moving flybridge hive further forward to better cover bow &ndash; started to look at this &ndash; it is on the port side of flybridge &ndash;I (ds) have contacted Robbie about getting us some more external cable.&nbsp; When I installed the Hive, the piece of cable thatI had was spliced and was bad. &nbsp;&nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t have a piece long enough to place it properly and I got the &ldquo;no money&rdquo; reply.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll move it when we get to WHOI in the spring and will install new cable. 2018-jan-30<span style="color:#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp; - I went up on flybridge and dug around in the chartroom overhead.&nbsp; I can not see that there is any excess cable there that would allow a move without re-running cable.&nbsp; It is hard to discern on the chartroom though.&nbsp; I might be wrong. (allison)</span></p>

<p>- HIVES - can&#39;t access hive manager - it is asking for a license or entitlement key.&nbsp; The key Laura sent does nto work (says it was already used - guess it expired)</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">REMOVE FOR CALIBRATION - AFTER NAAMES??? DO we have a calibrated sensor to put up?&nbsp; </span>RAD calibration - change wrong values?&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">emailed Robbie to check before changing - allison working on - cal&#39;s in sensor look okay except for gain on PSP (shortwave)&nbsp;-----RAD CALIBRATION DATA---------------------------------&#39;g&#39; --&gt;Set PSP amplifier gain value. (118.8)&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;o&#39; --&gt;Set PSP amplifier offset, mv. (0.8 mv)&nbsp; did not change in sensor - </span></p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">Can&#39;t do until Alvin group decides what they need on there.&nbsp; </span>Label Alvin smart switch &ndash; ports &ndash; <span style="color:#FF0000">2018-Jan-29 &ndash; not ready to label, not really anything configured yet.&nbsp; Alvinites need to&nbsp; make a list of what they want on there.</span></p>

<p>BUC software &ndash; connected in radome???&nbsp; Status of running software?</p>

<p>- at WHOI - the white wire on the .322 is only meggering to 646 M ohms.&nbsp; The rest of the wires are fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; ds will check for the fault at WHOI.&nbsp; We are beginning a cruise and I don&#39;t want to go ripping slip rings out or anything as long as we still have two good wires for this cruise.</p>

<p>************COMPLETE &ndash; below here&nbsp;</p>

<p><del>-stuff was moved around in the racks &ndash; the transducer board is not mounted, it is on top of the rack &ndash; not really sure why &ndash; where should it go now??&nbsp; It will block everything! <span style="color:#FF0000">Not really any other place to put it.&nbsp; The back of the Knudsen computer is not reachable.&nbsp; Hopefully that will not add heat, as whomever mounted the Knudsen computer this summer put it between teh two deck units with only a small gap above and below.</span></del></p>

<p><del>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE -</span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; check Milli-Q purity &ndash; needs to be 18.2MOhm water or change filter</del></p>

<p>-<del><span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE - DURING NEWCRUISE &#39; ing - </span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; increase chief sci mail filter to at least 2 Mb</del></p>

<p><del>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE - </span>HUTCHINS &ndash; putting FL on seawater system in a lab.&nbsp; How to monitor so sink won&rsquo;t overflow &ndash; should only need a trickle of water &ndash; our sump pump is missing.</del></p>

<p><del>-<span style="color:#FF0000">STARTED - </span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; need to get liquid nitrogen ready ahead for them &ndash; fill both dewars &ndash; if they are filling their dewars from our dewars (rather than 1 L pitcher) they need to bring it off the ship.&nbsp; STARTED LN2 SYSTEM 2018-Jan-25;&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">switched dewars 2018-Jan-28 &ndash; never went to full, but did not seem to still be transferring.&nbsp; Need to find out how high up on rod &ldquo;full&rdquo; is.&nbsp; Also checking on borrowing other dewar that Dave W. brought for OOI cruise (not his)</span></del></p>

<p><del>-finish documenting 2011 benchmarks in elog &ndash; done except for picure of PBM5 on flybridge (aft) - <span style="color:#FF0000">allison has all info, I (allison) just need to get a final photo and finish compiling info)</span></del></p>

<p>-<del>Test cyberoam blocking filters</del><span style="color:#FF0000"><del> - </del>when creating a new policy for the first time:&nbsp; if your policy is going to deny access to certain sites, start with the template &quot;Allow All&quot;;&nbsp; if your policy is going to only allow certain sites, start with the template &quot;deny all&quot;.&nbsp; I think the only time you can see which template you&#39;ve selected is when ou are creating the policy.&nbsp; There must be another way, but I haven&#39;t found it yet. </span></p>

<p><s>-remove old fiber run from computer lab to main lab alvin duping.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">I tested the new on, but am hesitant to remove the old until the new has been used for a while - maybe that is silly! changed my mind&nbsp; and removed the temporary</span></s></p>

<p>&nbsp;<del>Maggie &ndash; status of deck cable leaving hydrolab -</del> <span style="color:#FF0000">think it might actually be better to leave this just inside of hydrolab (ROV hangar door).&nbsp; otherwise it will just coorode anyway (Rox Bloc almost impossible to reach)</span></p>

<p>-<del>Re-run Alvin fiber computer lab to main lab<span style="color:#FF0000"> - working on this now _ dpne and tested - allison 2018-feb-1</span></del></p>

<p><s>-color printer computer lab - getting some lines down center of pages &ndash; Dave Sims fixed 2018-Jan-28 Well, maybe.&nbsp; It may need a new transfer belt which costs about $300.&nbsp; We can get a refurbished printer for about $400.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t order the part.&nbsp; Not only is it expensive, but it would be hard to hand cary it down to its size.&nbsp; If need be, we can move the printer from the main lab and change its address to .35 to get perfect printouts.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is a fix for the problem unit that will work for a while.&nbsp; </s></p>
