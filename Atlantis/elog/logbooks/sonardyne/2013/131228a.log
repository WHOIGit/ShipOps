========================================
<p>Jason group has new avtrak beacons this cruise that require the latest firmware/software version to be installed on the Sondardyne in order to use them. They will be installing this today, 28 December 2013. If for some reason upon the return of Alvin there is a problem, they can revert back to the previous version of the firmware/software.</p>
