Subject: [Usbl-group] USBL- Atlantis update</p>

<p><br />
I&#39;m sure many of you know some of this, but here is an update of what &nbsp;<br />
has been done on the Atlantis over the last few months.</p>

<p>-Information from Sonardyne suggested that the transceiver head on &nbsp;<br />
Atlantis was in danger of failing. &nbsp;Because of this, we decided to &nbsp;<br />
find a used transceiver head and swap it with the failing one on &nbsp;<br />
Atlantis. &nbsp;Sonardyne put us in touch with a rental outfit in Houston &nbsp;<br />
who gave us a good price.</p>

<p>-Alvin personnel carried out the swap on the pole with no issues.</p>

<p>-The &quot;new&quot; system did not operate properly when we first fired it up. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
(Ultimately, we did get it going.) &nbsp;What appeared to be happening was &nbsp;<br />
that the transceiver head was not booting up fast enough, or that the &nbsp;<br />
NSH was cycling the power to the transceiver head. &nbsp;It&#39;s not entirely &nbsp;<br />
clear. &nbsp;The problem was solved by using a separate power supply to &nbsp;<br />
power the transceiver head. &nbsp;Sonardyne has looked at some log files &nbsp;<br />
and says that the transceiver looks normal. &nbsp;So it&#39;s not entirely &nbsp;<br />
clear what&#39;s happening here and the issue is still open. &nbsp;However, the &nbsp;<br />
system seems to be fine when running on the external power supply. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
It&#39;s worth noting that this seems to be the third time that something &nbsp;<br />
sorta like this has happened, twice on Atlantis and I&#39;ve heard that &nbsp;<br />
Jason had this issue as well.</p>

<p>-The &quot;old&quot; transceiver head was left on the ship as a spare, since it &nbsp;<br />
has not actually failed at this time.</p>

<p>Other software update items that might be of interest:<br />
-&quot;Telemetry Tracking now makes 3 Spare Bytes available to the User in &nbsp;<br />
the 2-way SMS Messages&quot;<br />
-&quot;Vessel Position is now updated at GNSS Rate regardless of Acoustic &nbsp;<br />
Update Rate&quot;<br />
-&quot;When running on Windows 10, the Software crashed after connecting to &nbsp;<br />
the NSH - this has been fixed&quot;</p>

<p>-I don&#39;t know who else is using their PHINS for a TSS based RPH &nbsp;<br />
string, but if you are, you might not want to upgrade your firmware. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I&#39;m waiting to hear back from iXblue on this.</p>
