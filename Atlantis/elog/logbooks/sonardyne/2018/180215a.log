Subject: [Usbl-group] Atlantis Status</p>

<p><br />
All</p>

<p>Just a quick rundown of where we are on Atlantis and how we got there.</p>

<p>There are presently three distinct issues.</p>

<p>1- The transceiver is failing.</p>

<p>When we had the issues with the NSH, (see #2), Sonardyne in Houston &nbsp;<br />
asked for some tests to be done. &nbsp;I presume that these are sort of &nbsp;<br />
standard tests that get done for any issue. &nbsp;The results were pretty &nbsp;<br />
marginal.</p>

<p>Specifically, it&#39;s almost failing the Phase Cal test. &nbsp; &nbsp; As best as I &nbsp;<br />
can tell from communications with Sonardyne, this is just something &nbsp;<br />
that happens. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if it always happens, but it&#39;s happening &nbsp;<br />
to us. &nbsp;The system is a few years old. &nbsp;I&#39;ll just quote what Kyle in &nbsp;<br />
Houston (Sonardyne) said &nbsp;(some of his information is from the UK):</p>

<p>##############<br />
&quot;I sent the information you provided to the UK for review and the &nbsp;<br />
admittance test passed, but just barely. The UK engineer stated that &nbsp;<br />
the array is showing signs of aging and should be watched closely for &nbsp;<br />
tracking issues.</p>

<p>The phase calibrations were reviewed as well and below is the response &nbsp;<br />
from the engineer in the UK.</p>

<p>3- We have an issue with supplying the proper inputs at the proper &nbsp;<br />
rates. &nbsp;(roll/pitch/heading) &nbsp;It&#39;s a long story, but the Ranger2 &nbsp;<br />
software does not have the check box to reverse the roll and/or pitch &nbsp;<br />
inputs. &nbsp;(Ranger1 does) &nbsp;We were previously using that feature. &nbsp;When &nbsp;<br />
we lost the reverse feature, we had to switch to a different string, &nbsp;<br />
that string lacked heading, we don&#39;t have enough ports on the PHINS, &nbsp;<br />
etc.. &nbsp;This needs to be sorted out. &nbsp;Bottom line, (I think), is that &nbsp;<br />
the heading input rate is less than optimal. &nbsp;I think it&#39;s 1/sec, when &nbsp;<br />
it should be 5/sec or so.</p>

<p>Hi Mike</p>

<p>These are not the same symptoms that we saw with NSH. &nbsp;This is different.</p>

<p>Also, you just reminded me, I&#39;m not sure the series 5 head is &nbsp;<br />
repairable anymore. &nbsp;It might depend what&#39;s wrong, but I think they &nbsp;<br />
may not be allowed to work on it. &nbsp;(For the rest of you, this is some &nbsp;<br />
sort of EU pollution issue, might be about lead solder. &nbsp;Sonardyne is &nbsp;<br />
legally bound to follow the regulations.)</p>

<p>&gt; Hi Robbie,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Are these the same symptoms that were being seen due to the<br />
&gt; transceiver power dropping out, or are these different? Have you<br />
&gt; contacted Kim Sword to see if she has any heads available or if they<br />
&gt; will repair a series 5 head?<br />
