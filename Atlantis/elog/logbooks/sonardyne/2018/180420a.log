========================================
<p>Bought a &quot;new&quot;, (to us), used transducer head.&nbsp; Swapped out the head, no issues.&nbsp; When we powered up the new head, it did not seem to be working.&nbsp; Symptoms were basically that the software was unable to talk to the head, it would then issue a break command and cycle the power.&nbsp; This would continue indefinately.&nbsp; Tried swapping the head from port 3A to 3B, no change.&nbsp; Deleted the head in the software and reinstalled it, no change.&nbsp; Tried uploading new firmware, also did not fix the problem, although we did install a newer version of firmware.&nbsp; (however, the old version was fully compatable.&nbsp; What did finally work was putting the transceiver head on it&#39;s own 48v power supply.&nbsp; The system seems to work fine this way.</p>

<p>Speculation, but what might be happening is that the tranceiver is not booting fast enought.&nbsp; Why, I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; But it seems like the software is trying to reset the tranceiver before it has finished booting, and everything starts over again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put a beacon in the water and the system seems to work well.</p>
