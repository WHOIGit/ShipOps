========================================
<p>A post-midlife CASIUS was performed July 2021 to calibrate the new transceiver head.</p>

<p>Two results were generated, as data was collected with both the internal Lodestar attitude sensor and with an external attitude feed from the Kongsberg Seapath. Results were very similar. The final results uploaded from the CASIUS Tool into Ranger2 were the results using the internal Lodestar.</p>
