Subject: How to obtain a CSV file of the data similar to Ranger 1

========================================
<p>On Ranger2, CSVs are not automatically created. Instead, data is logged to hourly files in a SQL database.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To obtain a CSV file of data from a &quot;dive&quot;:</p>

<p>- You must have the job file of interest open.</p>

<p>-Navigate to Tools &gt; Maintenance &gt; Logging and see the time ranges for the different segments of the job. These may not necessarily correlate with the time you think they should be. Not sure why.</p>

<p>- In Ranger2 navigate to Tools &gt; Maintenance &gt; Data Export...</p>

<p>- Enter in the time/date range that you found above</p>

<p>-Select the check boxes for &quot;Depth Observations&quot;, &quot;GNSS Latitude Longitude Observations&quot; and &quot;Latitude Longitude Observations&quot; at a minimum, and anything else you may be interested in. Or select all just to be safe.</p>

<p>-DO NOT CHECK THE &quot;Time Ordered Data&quot; BOX. If you do you won&#39;t get any data. Once again, I don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p>-Click &quot;Export&quot;. Exports by default to C:\Users\Public\Documents\Sonardyne\Ranger2\Archives.</p>
