<p>Hi Catie,</p>

<p>The NSH failing to send power error just means that the TCVR is resetting, but the red light on the NSH is troubling,<br />
because it may be pulling high current. Can you swap the NSH TCVR card to slot 4 and see if you get the same indication.<br />
Can you also perform a phase calibration? Its located under tools &gt; advanced &gt; phase cal. Tracking must be off. And as<br />
always a CEF file during the incident is alway helpful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please let me know how this goes or if you have any further question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Kyle</p>

<p>Hello Kyle-<br />
Thank you for your earlier responses in regards to the earlier attitude<br />
and GPS feed questions.</p>

<p>Today another issue has arisen that I&#39;m hoping you can assist with. Today<br />
we have begun intermittently losing communications between the NSH and the<br />
transceiver. From looking at the events viewer, the sequence of events<br />
semms to be:</p>

<p>-Tranceiver 1 Calibration command failed<br />
(repeated 10x)<br />
-Transceiver 1 Resetting after 10 phase calibrations with span &gt; 30<br />
degrees<br />
-Calibration command failed<br />
-NSH 1 has failed to send power through transceiver card 3<br />
(repeated dozens of times)</p>

<p>The first time this occurred I tried closing and re-opening the software,<br />
and the situation did not resolve within ~10 minutes, so I power cycled<br />
the NSH, and this also failed to resolve the power issue within another<br />
~10 minutes.</p>

<p>At that point I power cycled again and moved the transceiver to port 3B<br />
from 3A, and I was able to communicate with the transceiver. However this<br />
eventually failed after a couple hours in the same fashion as the above<br />
events viewer log.</p>

<p>At this point I power cycled the NSH once more and moved the transceiver<br />
back to port 3A, and after about 2-3 minutes of &quot;NSH 1 has failed to send<br />
power through tranceiver card 3&quot; messages, the transceiver regained<br />
communications.</p>

<p>Another couple hours later the transceiver failed again in the same<br />
fashion, however I did nothing, and the tranceiver regained power and<br />
comms on its own after about 7-8 minutes.</p>

<p>During these &quot;failed to send power&quot; notifications, I can see that the<br />
lights under TCVR 3 on the front of the NSH oscillate between green 48V,<br />
lights, and the red warning light.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any troubleshooting assistance you can provide.</p>

<p>Catie</p>

&gt; I apologize for the delayed response. Ranger 2 does not have the option of changing the sign convention. This may need to<br />
be discussed with PHINS. I will ask the UK on Monday to be certain there are no workarounds but as far as we know here<br />
there isn&rsquo;t. I will also ask if we have definition for those strings spelled out somewhere.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Also, The GPS position only updating during beacon interrogations is normal. I have never noticed this, but Dan informed<br />
me it is normal, but could not remember why. I will ask the UK on Monday so we will both know.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br />
&gt;<br />
