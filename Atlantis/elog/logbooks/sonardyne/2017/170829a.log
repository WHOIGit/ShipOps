========================================
<p>Changed the offset for the GPS from negative to positive.&nbsp; Sonardyne wants the distance from the CRP _to_ the GPS.&nbsp; (and they also want the distance that the tranceiver is _below_ the CRP, and that&#39;s also positive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that is a bit weird.)</p>

<p>Lowered the pole at the dock.&nbsp;&nbsp; (50&#39; of water at this spot.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Put Beacon 813 in the water and tested the system.&nbsp; Beacon worked fine in two different locations, both of which were correct.&nbsp;</p>
