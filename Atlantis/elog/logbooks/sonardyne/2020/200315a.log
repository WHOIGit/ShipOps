Subject: Can't Update UTM zone if Waypoints are Entered in System
Cruise: at42-25

========================================
<p>From cruise report:</p>

<p><strong>USBL:</strong></p>

<p>Alvin had some in-sphere nav issues on a couple of dives, problem was traced to the waypoints that had been entered into Ranger2 during AT42-23. Because the USBL_2_DVL program sending location down to the sub via SMS runs on the Ranger2 computer, the UTM zone of sub nav was way off.&nbsp; When waypoints are entered into Ranger2, the system will not update its UTM zone. Once the waypoints were deleted, the UTM zone was updated and in-sphere sub nav displayed normally once again.</p>
