========================================
<p>With the help of the Cheng, I had the trackpoint pole lowered to full extension.&nbsp; Fully extended, the bottom of the transceiver is 80&quot; from the keel.</p>

<p><em>July 15, 2021:&nbsp; Update on the length of the pole.&nbsp; New HPT 7000 gyro head installed on the pole.&nbsp;&nbsp; This head is ~2&quot; longer than the old one.&nbsp; (52mm)&nbsp; Old distance from keel was 80&quot; or 2.032 meters below the keel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding 52mm, new depth is 2.084 meters below the keel.&nbsp; New CRP is 3.048m (10&#39;) above the keel.&nbsp;&nbsp; New distance below the CRP is 2.084 + 3.048 = 5.132 meters.&nbsp; Use 5.132 meters for your entry in the Sonardyne Ranger2 settings.&nbsp; (new CRP is located at frame 60, centerline, 10&#39; above the baseline.)</em></p>

<p>There were some signs of corrosion.&nbsp; The worst spot was on the forward facing side, and appeared to be in a spot where the pole may be making contact with another metal of some type.&nbsp; The reason I presumed this was because there was a sort of wear ring around the entire pole, suggesting contact with another surface, and a corrosion spot in one location centered on this ring (see picture below).</p>

<p>Some other corrosion spots (not as bad) had slight pitting and staining (see pictures below)</p>
