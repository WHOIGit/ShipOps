========================================
<p>Casius calibration performed on March 7 2016 (following overhaul and reinstallation of Sonardyne transducer 2015-2016) as joint effort between Alvin, Sentry, and SSSG groups, according to the below waypoints. Final casius report attached.</p>
<p>WAYPOINTS<br />
Pt-A: LAT= 12.9764 LON= -58.9818<br />
Pt-B: LAT= 12.9822 LON= -58.9889<br />
Pt-C: LAT= 12.9828 LON= -58.9824<br />
Pt-D: LAT= 12.9759 LON= -58.9883<br />
Pt-O: LAT= 12.9793 LON= -58.9854<br />
SHIP HDG: 130 when on waypoints<br />
WP-1: Pt-O<br />
WP-2: Pt-A<br />
WP-3: Pt-D<br />
WP-4: Pt-O<br />
WP-5: Pt-C<br />
WP-6: Pt-B<br />
WP-7: Pt-O<br />
Rotate ship to HDG: 310 on the following waypoints<br />
WP-8: Pt-A<br />
WP-9: Pt-C<br />
WP-10: Pt-O<br />
WP-11: Pt-D<br />
WP-12: Pt-B<br />
keep the ship heading constant during station keeping. In addition, before starting to<br />
collect data the heading should have been constant for a minute, although this time will<br />
depend on the VRU and the rate of heading change prior to this.<br />
Need to acquire 200 good hits or more at each station.</p>
<p>*Sentry has an excel spreadsheet that can be used to calculate the waypoints necessary for a CASIUS survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>time values from CASIUS calibration on 7 March...<br />
Elevator Descent: 29m/min (2km ~68min)<br />
CASIUS survey time: 6h 20min<br />
CASIUS verification: 45min<br />
Elevator Ascent??<br />

========================================
<p>&nbsp;I moved the PHINS data feed such that it was going directly into the <br />
Sonardyne NCU.&nbsp; This appears to have stopped the occasional error that <br />
Ranger would display complaining about losing the PHINS data feed.&nbsp; I <br />
also created a Y cable that will allow the data feed to continue going <br />
into the moxa.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> If I had to guess, another CASIUS would be required to <br />
calibrate the pitch/roll/heading offsets in this setup.&nbsp; There is no <br />
current plan to do another CASIUS on this cruise.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp; We will plan to dive with the original setup since we don't know how <br />
the new setup into the NCU will affect the calibrated offsets.<br />
</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the spare 232 card for the added data feed into the NCU, I <br />
would suggest Alvin/SSSG buy another.&nbsp; Here is the info...<br />
