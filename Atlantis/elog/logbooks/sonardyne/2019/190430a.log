========================================
<p>A Casius Survey was performed 2019-Apr-15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>*******************************</p>

<p>The data were sent to Kyle Warren:&nbsp;&nbsp; (we did not give him any transceiver depth info.&nbsp; his values differ slightly in transceiver offsets)</p>

<p>Hi Allison,</p>

<p>Please find the PDF from the CASIUS with zeroed offsets. I would leave the TCVR STBD/FWD offsets alone and only change the pitch, roll, and<br />
heading offsets, as I am sure the physical TCVR offsets were surveyed in. Also, the calculated STBD/FWD offsets are pretty close to the<br />
before offsets in the PDF attached.</p>

<p>The CASIUS doesn&rsquo;t look too bad, but I do see an elongated pattern in the 2D after plot below(top). Was the vessel actually changing heading<br />
by +-5 degrees during the CASIUS or could there be an issue with the Gyro drifting? The plot at the bottom is what the 2D after plot should<br />
look closer to (IMAGE 4).</p>

<p>I will send this data to the UK to see if there is anything they can do to help, but the CASIUS doesn&rsquo;t look horrible, you should be able to<br />
track fairly well with these results, unless there is another issue.</p>

<p>Do you have any .CAS2 files you can send to me as well? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Kyle Warren &nbsp;| Operations Manager</p>

<p>Sonardyne Inc</p>

<p>The new job file uses the transceiver offsets from teh survey data as suggested by Kyle.</p>

========================================
<p><strong>IN SELECTING WAYPOINT LOCATIONS:&nbsp; Do both the ship&#39;s heading and survey locations need to be rotated together (i.e. survey heading 45/225, waypoints out from beacon at 45, 135, 225, 315?&nbsp; The answer is &quot;NO&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i.e. it may be easier for ship manuevering, but not necessary for survey)</strong></p>

<div>Subject: Question about manuevering guidelines for CASIUS surveys</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I am on the R/V Atlantis.&nbsp; We recently performed a CASIUS survey.&nbsp; The survey had been planned out in the morning.&nbsp; We had planned to do a headings 45 degrees / 225 degrees.&nbsp; The four locations 500 meters horizontally away from the beacon selected were at 45, 135, 225, 315 degrees.&nbsp; However, when we arrived 12 hours later, at the beacon location, a heading of 60 degrees was better for the ship.&nbsp; So, we used 60 / 240 headings, but we used the same selected locations from the beacon (45, 135, 225, 315).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>My understanding of the directions that specified rotation of the pattern (this is from Appendix G - CASIUS Data Collection Methods, p. 323, Ranger 2 USBL Manual) meant that if the cardinal points N-E-S-W were not specifically used, the points selected should still form a square when connected.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Another colleague disagreed with my interpretation and explained that I should have used locations 500 meters out from the beacon at 60, 150, 240, 330 degrees with the ship headings 60 / 240 degrees.&nbsp; Although I can see where it might be possible to interpret the directions in Appendix G that way, I thought that was extending beyond the rotation in the diagram and it doesn&#39;t make sense to me that would be necessary (why does it matter at what angle the ship faces the beacon - isn&#39;t the transducer head multi-directional).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Do both the ship&#39;s heading and survey locations need to be rotated together? In other words, if my ship headings are going to be 23 degrees / 203 degrees, do my locations away from the beacon have to be at 23, 113, 203, 293 degrees?&nbsp; If yes, an you explain why this is the case (or point me to some Sonardyne Reference where I can read about it)?</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>You are correct, the headings and cardinal points used during the CASIUS do not need to correlate.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As long as the same heading and its recipricol are used throughout the CASIUS and, as you said, the cardinal points make a square, then the results should be fine. (Never use a heading of 0 or 180)</div>
