========================================
<p>2013-May-25 Chris Griner has been immensely helpful while we've been at dock.&nbsp; His vast talents, which include a delightful attitude while sugee'ing will be greatly missed as we sail off into the Gulf Stream!</p>
<p>PRESENT DAY - We sure hope to have Chris visit for a sugee session prior to the upcoming inspection ...</p>
<p>NEW PRESENT DAY - It was great having Chris' help during the 2015 NSF inspection :) </p>
