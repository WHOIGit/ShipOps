========================================
<p>I put the &#39;background rsync to shore for large files&#39; on ftp user crew. I updated the pw file.</p>

<p>crew@ftp:/home/crew/outgoing goes to atlsci@:128.128.250.51:/srv/ftp/pub/ship/atlantis/science/incoming</p>

<p>and<br />
atlsci@:128.128.250.51:/srv/ftp/pub/ship/atlantis/science/outgoing crew@ftp:/home/crew/incoming</p>

<p>The user crew is running the copy in cron.</p>

<p>It should work the same as it is did on mnemosysn. I am not sure if the crew would put files in the outgoing or if you all (sssg) did it for<br />
them, but it might be easier to put them there for them.</p>

<p>I have the 64 bit Windoze Bitdefender rsyncing over currently with bw=6.</p>
