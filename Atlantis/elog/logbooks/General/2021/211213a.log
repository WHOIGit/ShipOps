----------------------------------------</p>

<p>Just a reminder that you must fill out a shipping request if you want your shipment to be insured.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ship from WHOI,<br />
of course this happens automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you ship from say, San Francisco to Katy TX by Fedex, and you just hand<br />
the boxes to Fedex, it WON&#39;T be insured, UNLESS you fill out a shipping request.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not matter what you put down for<br />
the value, our deal with Fedex only provides $100 of insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;For shipments that are not going out of WHOI, you can fill<br />
out a shipping request and put &quot;for insurance purposes only&quot; in the notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might even be able to talk someone in the<br />
office into doing it for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of vendors ask for our Fedex number to ship stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fine, but again, you must fill out the shipping request<br />
or it will not be insured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>See the attached web page for more details, but basically, if you did not fill out a shipping request, it&#39;s almost certainly<br />
not insured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are having thousands of dollars worth of stuff being shipped to WHOI, you should check with the vendor<br />
as to who is insuring it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything shipped FOB is WHOI&#39;s responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vendor will happily load the stuff on the<br />
truck to ship it, but once they do that, if it&#39;s FOB, it&#39;s no longer their responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
