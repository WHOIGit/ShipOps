========================================
<p>Laura had some good points about streamlining the email communications mentioned below. By using sssg@whoi.edu bwalden,<br />
dfisichella, lstolp, rlaird, cgriner are copied automatically. Lets start with the following and make changes as<br />
appropriate.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
David<br />
<br />
A ctd issue would go to:<br />
mswartz@whoi.edu, sssg@whoi.edu<br />
<br />
A multibeam issue would go to:<br />
plemmend@whoi.edu, sssg@whoi.edu<br />
<br />
a computer issue:<br />
lstolp@whoi.edu, sssg@whoi.edu<br />
<br />
a lab setup issue question:<br />
cgriner@whoi.edu, ebenway@whoi.edu, sssg@whoi.edu<br />
<br />
calliope question<br />
lstolp@whoi.edu, sssg@whoi.edu<br />
<br />
If they send questions, shopping list, problems to the 'person of choice' and sssg@whoi.edu, then everyone is in the<br />
loop...<br />
<br />
&gt; Roles and Responsibilities<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; With Robbie primarily working ashore this is a good time to review who the points of contact will be here at the office.<br />
&gt; For Networking and Sat Comminucations, Laura will be the primary and Robbie the secondary contacts. For sensors,<br />
&gt; electronics and navigation, Robbie is primary and Laura the secondary. I would like them to be copied even is you request<br />
&gt; information from Marshall. With Marshall's cruise schedule he is away from WHOI more than he is here, and even though he<br />
&gt; is very responsive we need to maintain some internal control of our hydrographic systems. For Multi-beam it will be Peter<br />
&gt; Lemmond and Robbie, For mechanical equipment, including winches, vans etc, it will be Chris and Robbie. Jamie will be<br />
&gt; dedicating more of his time as the East Coast Winch Pool ramps up, so any pooled winch issues should be addressed to him.<br />
&gt; For the VPR it's Josh and Robbie. Coring equipment issues should be sent to Ellen Roosen with Hovey and Chris secondary<br />
&gt; contacts. Diving support is obviously Ed O'Brien, but Chad Smith is now on-hand to assist in Ed's absence. (Ed is<br />
&gt; presently evaluating new re-breather technology in Greece on a project with Brendan Foley). If there is something that<br />
&gt; needs my attention, and is not related to personnel matters, please CC Laura and Robbie. That will assure that someone<br />
&gt; sees it and that it doesn't get lost in the abyss of my in-box. As for items requireing Fathi's attention, I'm sorry to<br />
&gt; report that there is no back-up. She is the only one of us that is not replaceable.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; These contacts will be both resources for the techs at sea, but also coordinators of information. In some cases where a<br />
&gt; problem, such as with HSN, requires modifications to be made on multiple ships, the shore contact will provide the<br />
&gt; necessary direction to make sure that we follow a coordinated trouble-shooting plan. To facilitate this, please copy both<br />
&gt; the primary and secondary contacts on any communications related to the above. This is especially true for email going to<br />
&gt; vendors. Sometimes when they reply they don't &quot;reply to all&quot; and threads get broken.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; It is very important for everyone to realize that establishing these protocols in no way indicates a lack of confidence<br />
&gt; in our at-sea ability to take charge and resolve problems. On the contrary, in many cases our best expertise exists on<br />
&gt; the ships. This is instead necessary for continuity, communication and record keeping, and is especially true if a<br />
&gt; problem spans many cruises where the techs may change.<br />
<br />
Etherpad<br />
<br />
I want to stress that everyone should now be consulting SSSG Etherpad regularly. I admit that I have been slow to<br />
start, but the more I look at it the more value I recognize that it has. As a minimum I want us to to track all<br />
cruise critical items and tasks with it. This will allow anyone in the group to know the status of an issue at a<br />
glance no matter where we are. Laura has been great about putting the important notes from the pre-cruise meetings<br />
on the pad in almost real time. I'm going to get a notebook PC to have here in the office so that whoever goes to<br />
the meeting can do the same in Laura's absence. If you know of anything that needs to be added, or have a question<br />
about what is needed for a cruise, write it on the cruise page. This won't take the place of the SSSG chart, but<br />
will prevent items from falling though the cracks if we all keep up with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ship's Sat Comm Bandwidth<br />
<br />
As we predicted some time ago, per MB charges for Internet connectivity at sea can come back and byte us. There have<br />
been some recent occurrences where large volumes of traffic were sent over FBB at considerable cost. This is in<br />
large part because everyone has been conditioned to not paying for bandwidth usage, and between the science party<br />
and ship's crew the pipe has been getting full. SSSG is not going to be the Internet police, but we will have to<br />
start making more of an effort to educate all the users on what is allowed and not allowed on the ships networks. To<br />
this end we need to establish these ground rules with the crew and every on-coming science party:<br />
<br />
1. No P2P software<br />
2. No automatic software updates<br />
3. No video or audio streaming<br />
4. No visiting web sites prohibited in the WHOI IT Acceptable use document:<br />
www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=18997&amp;&amp;ct=901&amp;cid=422 *<br />
<br />
The only exceptions to 1-3 are when necessary to meet the needs of the science mission or for ship business.<br />
<br />
We need to let all users know that we have the ability to monitor traffic and will do so if necessary.<br />
<br />
The FBB provider can provide WHOI with a blacklist of site addresses that they have collected. We are looking into<br />
incorporating this list for all HSN traffic as well.<br />
<br />
If issues arise during a cruise please bring it to our attention ashore and to the captain. Al Suchy, and the<br />
captains that I have talked to agree that the captains can be the one's to come down hard on bandwidth abusers.<br />
<br />
* I've copied the more pertinent parts of the Acceptable Use document below.<br />
<br />
CTD Connectors<br />
<br />
I'm going to be talking to Marshall about defining a standard for sea cable connectors (Mecca vs 2 pin RMG).<br />
Whatever is decided, I'll have Rick order a bunch so that each ship has plenty. If you have any thoughts on the<br />
subject let Robbie know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ship Status<br />
<br />
As everyone knows, Oceanus will be permanently laid-up after November. I do not know the exact plans that NSF has<br />
for the ship, but I have heard they will ask WHOI to sell her. At this time it is also unclear what we will be able<br />
to do with the science equipment on board. There are plans for a commemoration ceremony when she returns from her<br />
final cruise. Robb Hagg will continue on with WHOI in a relief capacity, but will also be involved in the new NSF<br />
tech pool pilot program. This program is designed to provide relief tech support to any vessel in the UNOLS fleet<br />
and will be administered by UNOLS.<br />
<br />
WHOI was recently approached by the owner of the M/V Alucia with a grant of over $1 million. Most of this money will<br />
be used to fund Access to the Sea science proposals, but some has been set aside for us to help set up Alucia as a<br />
more versatile research platform. Alucia was used by the Remus group earlier this year in the search for the Air<br />
France jet off Brazil. You may ask why WHOI would get involved in a potentially competing research vessel, and the<br />
answer is that the owner will be donating free ship time to WHOI researchers. There may also be some long-term<br />
involvement between SSSG and this ship.<br />
<br />
An announcement of the designer and shipyard to produce the Oceans Class Agor 27 for WHOI has been postponed until<br />
probably next month. Until the Navy makes this announcement there is little WHOI can do to participate in the<br />
project. Once the announcement is made I expect that we will be called upon to evaluate and suggest changes to the<br />
design and equipment of the vessel.<br />
<br />
RVTEC Meeting<br />
<br />
Everyone should have seen the announcement for the RVTEC meeting in November. I'm committed to sending as many of<br />
you who are able/interested in participating. The expectation is that if you go you will present either a poster or<br />
a talk. The topics can be on just about anything related to what we do, so if you have anything of interest let me<br />
know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Access to the Sea Award<br />
<br />
SSSG is part of an Access to the Sea award that will develop autonomous aerial vehicles for research, both from land<br />
and from ships. One component that we will be working on is deploying and landing small (8 foot wingspan) radio<br />
controlled aircraft from a ship. At some point we will want to do some airflow studies of the turbulence around the<br />
aft end of a moving vessel as well as develop ways to retrieve a vehicle at sea. If anyone is inclined to think<br />
about this and has some unique ideas please pass them on to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far we've had a good year with very few crises and many happy science parties. Thanks to all of you for your hard<br />
work and dedication to getting the job done.<br />
