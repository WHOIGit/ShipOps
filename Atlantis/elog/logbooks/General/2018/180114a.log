&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subject: Training profiles for SSSG Technicians</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>David &ndash; Low Level Radioactive Waste manifest online training is now available on the EH&amp;S Training Management System and can be accessed at the<br />
following link: Low Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Marine Ops) Online Training [ehs.whoi.edu] if you would please forward to the SSSG technicians<br />
that would be a big help.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also please ensure that this training is listed as &ldquo;required&rdquo; on their profiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ron also mentions in his email below that there may be additional trainings which need to be added to the SSSG techs profiles as &ldquo;required&rdquo; for<br />
example, Hazardous Waste Generator (HWG) [ehs.whoi.edu], Hazard Communication and Chemical Safety Training (HazCom) [ehs.whoi.edu] and Radiation<br />
Refresher Safety [ehs.whoi.edu] training etc. the good news is most can be completed online.&nbsp;&nbsp;However &ldquo;initial&rdquo; Radiation Safety training is conducted<br />
as an ad hoc session and should be scheduled by contacting EH&amp;S however Radiation Safety refresher training can be completed online.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a reminder to add or remove required trainings please follow the instructions below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log into TMS: http://ehstraining.whoi.edu/Default.aspx [ehstraining.whoi.edu]&nbsp;&nbsp;(log in is LDAP username and password same as your email<br />
username and password)</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once logged in the first screen that appears will be your training profile which will have 3 tabs at the top: &quot;Class Schedule&quot; &quot;Your<br />
Training&quot; and &quot;Employee&quot; please access the &quot;Employee&rdquo; tab and pull up the employee&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the employee&rsquo;s profile appears &ndash; go to the drop down menu at the bottom of the screen to add/remove required trainings (attached<br />
Supervisor Screen example).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
