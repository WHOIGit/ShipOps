&gt; Hi Amy,<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; I talked with several people from IS about Monday&#39;s Webmail DUO, here is what I know:<br />
&gt; ** Access to WHOI webmail: https://newwebmail.whoi.edu/login.php will require DUO authentication starting Monday, if accessing from<br />
outside WHOI&#39;s IP space of 128.128.0.0.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; ** if the ship is using HSN, webmail via https://newwebmail.whoi.edu/login.php should work fine.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; ** if you are using &nbsp;your VPN access to:<br />
&gt; https://newwebmail.whoi.edu/login.php &nbsp;should work fine.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; ** if HSN is down, you will need to use either the VPN or DUO for webmail access via https://newwebmail.whoi.edu/login.php both will<br />
ask the same question.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; ** If you are using IMAP w/ thunderbird or some other mailer it should work the same this week and next week. The DUO authentication<br />
should not affect how IMAP authenticates.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; Hope that helps.<br />
