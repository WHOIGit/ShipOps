Hello Chad,<br />
<br />
Please inform all parties concerned that above products are prohibited entry in Mexico via Airfreight at ALL airports , unless specific permit<br />
<br />
is obtained from Mexican Department of Energy or other Mexican Authority.<br />
<br />
We are sending this warning to avoid any / all possible problems in clearing customs in Guadalajara airport or other airports in Mexico.<br />
<br />
Prior to shipping , will need lists of products to be shipped and we will run it by our Customs Agent in Guadalajara and see if it is permited<br />
<br />

<br />
This is very important, in our opinion.<br />
<br />
Most of the stuff is also available in Mexico and given enough time / notice we may be able to obtain it from GDL or other big City in Mexico<br />
<br />
Monterey or Mexico City.<br />
