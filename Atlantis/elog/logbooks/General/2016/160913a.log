Good day Everyone,<br />
<br />
I received this written reply from the State Department regarding the issue of testing equipment:<br />
<br />
&quot;Testing ship&rsquo;s equipment- If you are outside 12 nm, a permit for testing equipment is not required.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s it-<br />
<br />

Allison and AD,<br />
<br />
I've been stuck in back-to-back meetings all day, so I'm now just catching up on this thread. I see that Kerry<br />
responded and I agree with her response.<br />
<br />
For the future, the collection of engineering , calibration, and equipment testing data, does not require a permit<br />
within an EEZ. That said, there may be instances where the ship is in waters that are less than politically<br />
friendly. In these cases, to minimize unnecessary attention we should avoid gathering engineering data that<br />
requires putting something over the side.<br />
<br />
The issue here should not be collecting the data, but who we allow access to it. I'm happy to take responsibility<br />
for this in the future in instances where the data is to go off the ship.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
David<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hi allison i&rsquo;m unclear why eric benway is involved in this discussion<br />
<br />
he no longer is the WHOI ship scheduler, kerry strom is- &nbsp;and i thought we had all agreed that the data<br />
were for engineering purposes and would not be used in any other way.<br />
<br />
we&rsquo;d like to get the data analyzed by paul/vicki ASAP and we do need to know the current effective<br />
swath width of the ASAP so we can refine our field plan.<br />
<br />
it is also important for us to know whether any other intervention by kongsberg is required over the<br />
next few weeks before the ship leaves the US and heads south for many months.<br />
<br />
thanks and best regards<br />

We (on the ship) were waiting for word from Eric Benway for sending EEZ data. &nbsp;I have not heard<br />
anything back yet, so Vicki and Paul have only seen the screen shots I sent them.<br />
<br />
After following their (Paul and Vicki) guidance and doing the calibration procedure, I feel<br />
confident that the finding (that the additional offsets were all zero) is valid - if that is of<br />
any help.<br />

Hi Allison,<br />
No problem, I totally understand.<br />
Send the data to the external people with the disclaimer that, &quot;The data is only<br />
to be used to test &amp; calibrate the equipment.&quot;<br />
That should cover all our butts!<br />

&gt; Hi Kerry,<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; I am emailing you directly, because I still see some ambiguity here.&nbsp; I did<br />
perform a calibration/testing during the transit.&nbsp; There are data recorded from<br />
that calibration.&nbsp; Dan F. wants me to send that data to Paul &amp; Vicki (multibeam<br />
committee) for confirmation that calibration was performed correctly.&nbsp; I am fine<br />
with that, but it involves sending the data to people outside of WHOI.&nbsp; Is that<br />
specifically covered by what you said/specified?<br />
&gt; I am sorry if I am being extra specific, etc.&nbsp; Yes, I am trying to cover myself<br />
and the ship as far as any liability.&nbsp; But that is because I do not completely<br />
understand all of the laws and specifications.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Thanks,<br />

&gt;&gt; Hi Kerry OK, thanks for the response on this.<br />
&gt;&gt; I assume then that Allison can go ahead and send the data to Paul Johnson at<br />
UNH and Vicki<br />
&gt;&gt; Ferrini at LDEO who are the leads of the UNOLS Multibeam Advisory Committee<br />
(MAC) and whom<br />
&gt;&gt; we have worked with to plan for the acquisition of the Patch data.&nbsp; They are<br />
helping us<br />
&gt;&gt; assess the Atlantis&rsquo; multibeam system status.<br />
&gt;&gt; I think Allison is waiting for the OK from someone here at WHOI to be able to<br />
do that, and<br />
&gt;&gt; I&rsquo;m asking that you specifically send that OK - we are all agreed that the data<br />
are not to<br />
&gt;&gt; be used for anything other than engineering purposes to evaluate the system<br />
performance.<br />
&gt;&gt; Thank you<br />
&gt;&gt; Dan<br />

&gt;&gt; Good day Everyone,<br />
&gt;&gt; Please be advised that the data should not be shared beyond the intent it is<br />
being<br />
&gt;&gt; used for.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dan said, the data is for engineering/ calibrations testing, and<br />
&gt;&gt; that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; The data should not be shared with the public, or to aid/ add to<br />
&gt;&gt; scientific projects in any way. <br />
&gt;&gt; The request to calibrate the EM122 was made too late in the year, we could not<br />
submit<br />
&gt;&gt; a research application that would allow the data to be used and shared within<br />
the<br />
&gt;&gt; science community. Sorry.<br />
&gt;&gt; The data is for equipment calibration purposes only.&nbsp; <br />
&gt;&gt; FYI: These requests should go through me, as far in advance as possible so it<br />
can go<br />
&gt;&gt; through the proper channels at the State Department. <br />
&gt;&gt; Eric Benway will continue to be a strong resource for WHOI, which is why you<br />
will see<br />
&gt;&gt; me CC him into email chains at times.<br />
&gt;&gt; I hope this clears things up.<br />
