========================================
<p>Just a reminder (thought I sent something out earlier), but I think I got lost..<br />
<br />
For data going to the DLA, can you all be sure to fill out the<br />
mailhost/linus:/home/data/cruise.metadata<br />
and check that the mailhost/linus:/home/data/underway/doc files are up to date. If you make any changes to<br />
/home/data/underway/doc files, if you copy them back to /home/data.template/underway/doc , that should keep them<br />
up to date after running newcruise.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have quesitons.<br />
