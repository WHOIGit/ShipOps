Subject: Calibration and Checks for ship INSTRUMENTATION<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems like we should treat this like other calibrations ie CTD. The CTD is easy (ish), we ask for a new<br />
set once a year, but the instrumentation attached to the vessel is a little harder.<br />
<br />
The multibeams, em122/em710, we should ask NSF for ship time to do the em122/em710 patch test, once a year,<br />
or what MAC recommends.<br />
<br />
The EK80 is probably different, it sounds like it is dependent on the area and target species, so this one<br />
science would need to request as part of their cruise.<br />
<br />
Sonardyne Cassius, sounds like it is something that needs to be done if something is changed, or maybe it is<br />
something that should be checked once every two years?<br />
<br />
The ADCP's are being watch constantly by UHDAS which is already sponsored by NSF.<br />
<br />
The 'wet' underways, SBE45, Fluor (except for the Tioga) we do once a year.<br />
<br />
The AML sound velocity on Armstrong, are we considering this wet?<br />
<br />
The 'dry' underways, Vaisalla, SBE48,&nbsp; every 2 years.<br />
<br />
The new SW, LW, and PAR, we need to decide on, the old SWR and LWR were once a year for check ups w/ Frank<br />
Bahr, if we missed this opportunity they disappeared into darkness.<br />
<br />
The CTD sal, temp and O2 we have done once a year (except for the Tioga), pressure seems like a check every<br />
5 years (should probably nail this down), CTD FLR, CTD TRANS seems to be anywhere from 3-7 years (think we<br />
need a better understanding of this).<br />
The Biospherical PAR and SPAR are a mystery. Catie, Alison and I can dig up emails where Marshall says once<br />
a year, but I think we are well over 3 years on average. On the Armstrong the Biospherical_QSP2300 is 2010<br />
(6 years) and the QSR-2200 2/20/2013.<br />
<br />
I am sure I missed some, feel free to add to the list. I think it would help to show Dan or others, that we<br />
have done our due diligence if we have a 'calibration'/systems check.<br />

&gt; Something we should discuss at some point. If science has certain expectations for<br />
&gt; calibration (I.E. EK80) or surveys we need to make sure we understand what they are and be<br />
&gt; able to explain to science exactly how much time and what resources are required.<br />
