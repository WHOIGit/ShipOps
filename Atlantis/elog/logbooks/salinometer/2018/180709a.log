========================================
<p>A good example can be found in the HOTS (Hawaii Ocean Time Series) cruise site. This has been going on for many years<br />
and is still current. <s>I&#39;ve attached the log sheet sample and relevant information.</s> This pertains to the Autosal, but<br />
will apply as well to use of the Portasal.<br />
The important thing is that this is manually written log sheet, not typed in as the sampling is done. Using a keyboard<br />
while taking samples introduces more problems... keep it simple, use pencil and paper, and be careful.</p>

<p>Browse through this site for some excellent info.&nbsp;<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
And remember that the drain tube should never touch the water in the drain tank... let it drip out of the tube.</p>
