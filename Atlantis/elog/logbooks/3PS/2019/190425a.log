========================================
<p>We ran through a calibration check. &nbsp;The values were out of spec. &nbsp;So, we re-calibrated. &nbsp;We ran a set of calibration check values. &nbsp;We<br />
had one reading that was off by about 6% (close to 1000 lbs tension). &nbsp;So, we went back up to close to 1000 lbs and ran three more numbers<br />
(~1000, ~500, close to 0). &nbsp;This time the values looked good. &nbsp;So, we called it done!</p>

<p>The values in the 3ps right now are:</p>

<p>Low sensor value &nbsp;3932.284<br />
Low display value &nbsp;0</p>

<p>High sensor value &nbsp; 6072.136<br />
High display value &nbsp; 4057<br />
&nbsp;</p>
