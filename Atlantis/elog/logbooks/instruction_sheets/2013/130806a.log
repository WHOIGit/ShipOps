So you are correct in that most of the ship service seawater outlets on deck around the ship are hose thread. However, on the van deck<br />
a ship service seawater specifically for van/science use was installed, and it happens to have a 1 1/2 inch female Banjo on it on the<br />
ship side. (aka we need a 1 1/2 in male-to-hose fitting). The (U)CSW line that was run up there also has a 1 1/2 in banjo on it. There<br />
was a drain line installed at the same time, it has a 2 in female banjo on the ship side. I was less concerned about that one this<br />
minute since I'm not positive if all of these incubators (if they put them up there) will need to drain separately or whatnot.<br />
