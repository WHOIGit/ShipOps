========================================
<p>Updated and corrected CSV file outputs. Changed most&nbsp; &quot;generic&quot; designators (HRH, AT, PRC, Wnd_Dir, Wnd_Spd) used by the web utilities to read from the starboard Vaisala instead of the IMET sensors, as the IMETs appear to be drifting farther and farther out of calibration. The IMET values as well as all Vaisala values still appear in the CSV file, just the &quot;generic&quot; designators were either added or changed to simplify the designators used by web utilities and NOAA and SAMOS transfers.&nbsp; The web utilities and the NOAA and SAMOS transfer config files were also modified to compensate for these changes and correct so that they are both getting all of their required data from the &quot;best&quot; available sensor.</p>
<p>The Vaisala barometric pressure values output to the CSV file were also changed to compensate for the 19.5 m height above the waterline, just as the IMET has been. This corrected value is now output as WXTP_Pa and WXTS_Pa in the CSV file (the original WXTP_TP &amp; WXTS_TP variables are no longer defined). The Metadata entries have been corrected. The BPR value is still obtained from the IMET sensor and the SAMOS data file does not include the two Vaisala sensor pressure values (we may wish to change this).</p>
<p>Nothing should be changed now unless something happens to a sensor!</p>
