========================================
<p>The CP90 (GP-90D) feed had a $GPDTM string in it, that would often be the first piece of information in 55009 UDP broadcast data.&nbsp; This string was then the one grabbed for the data file in /home/data/shiptrack/asciilog.&nbsp; This caused the latitude and longitude data to appear as all zeros.&nbsp; The problem was not discovered until we were missing an entire day of lat and long plots on the &quot;Last 24 Hour Underway Plots&quot; on the ship's website (probably not discovered because the $GPDTM string was often missing in the previous days, and when it was missing from the GPS receiver data string, everything worked fine).&nbsp; The problem was not investigated and fixed until June 25th, therefore, the lat and long data in the asciilog directory data files is missing entirely for June 23 and 24, and partially on the 25th).&nbsp; The lat and long data in the .csv file is fine.</p>
