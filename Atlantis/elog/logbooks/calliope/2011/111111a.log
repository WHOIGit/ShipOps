========================================
<p>Missing data 10-Nov-2011 15:51Z-16:28Z</p>
<p>I was working on a 422 CNAV feed to the em122 system.&nbsp; ComET &amp; I changed the GPS feed to the Phins to 9600.&nbsp; THis did not work with somethings on the bridge, so we changed it back.&nbsp; During this process I noticed we lost both Vaisala true wind speeds and directions (the relatives were still there) and the Phins heading.&nbsp; I reset the IMET's with teh power switch (this was probably unnecessary, but at teh time I didn't realize the relative values were there).&nbsp; ANyway, as I was checking the HDG feed in the computer lab, it all came back.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think the initial change to 9600 baud knocked it out (at least the heading) and it just took a little while to come back (processing through some garbage)</p>
