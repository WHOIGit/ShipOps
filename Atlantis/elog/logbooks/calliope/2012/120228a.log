========================================
<p>THe definition for the Stbd Vaisala true wind direction in Calliope was lost during a system reboot.&nbsp; THis caused the variable WXTS_TD to grab the first element in the string (speed) and log it, rather than the appropriate element.&nbsp; This was fixed 18:40 GMT 2/28/2012 (effected data from about 12:00 GMT 2/26/2012 until now).</p>
