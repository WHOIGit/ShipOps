&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; On the Dashboard, can you please look look for the IMEI number. The IMEI<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; number (International Mobile Equipment Identity) of the terminal. This is a<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; unique number that identifies your terminal.<br />
The IMEI number should be 35162402-022366-7</p>
