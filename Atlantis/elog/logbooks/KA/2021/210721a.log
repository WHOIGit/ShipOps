========================================
<p>Networking out of the Ka band FX antennas: All traffic to the outside world appears as 182.50.191.108 as of July 2021. Now, if change satellites and our location in the world, it is possible our outside world IP will change to either 193.220.213.88 or 193.220.200.56. This will have to be checked if the mail run to WHOI breaks or something.</p>

<p>LAN1 of Top Xchange box = 10.0.1.1 gateway.</p>

<p>LAN1 is cabled to sg20-1 switch, port 1 (VLAN 220).</p>

<p>sg20-1 also has port 2 and 3 on VLAN 220.</p>

<p>The Peplink WAN3 is attached to sg20-1 port 2. Peplink&#39;s IP is 10.0.1.2.</p>

<p>The satcomms fitlet is attached to sg20-1 port 3. It&#39;s IP on 192.168.11.251 on interface eno1 is 10.0.1.3.</p>

<p>10.0.1.2 and 10.0.1.3 are set as &quot;machine&quot; IPs on the FX system (more on connecting and configuring this below) with internet access. No other IPs on this network will go out to the internet. For example, for troubleshooting if you wanted to see if the plain ol&#39; FX system could get out to the internet, plug the Marlink laptop into the top Xchange Box and set the IP to 10.0.1.3 prefix 28 gw 10.0.1.1, dns 8.8.8.8. If you set the Marlink laptop to 10.0.1.4, you will not be connected to outside world internet.</p>

<p>&quot;LAN2&quot; (10.0.2.1) and &quot;port 5&quot; (10.0.4.1) on the top Xchange Box are set for the phones. The LAN2 phone is currently direct patched to the chart room. It&#39;s outside world phone number is 1-646-817-3698. &quot;Port 5&quot; is patched via VLAN 2332 to the Master Cabin. This may not be working right now (7/21/21) as I think the master cabin switch config did not get saved when it was programmed to include VLAN 2332. It&#39;s outside phone number is supposed to be 1-646-817-3699. Eventually we would like to move to an FX phone in the chart room, a sealink phone in the master cabin, an fx phone in the hospital, and a sealink phone for dialing out for the phone system from the comp lab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To connect to the FX networking (as much as we can, very limited, this interface is not useful for much):</p>

<p>Plug Marlink laptop into like &quot;port 5&quot; on the top Xchange Box. Set Marlink laptop IP to 10.0.4.2, prefix 28, gw 10.0.4.1, dns 8.8.8.8. (I say like, because you could do this from any of the 10.0.1.1, 10.0.2.1, or 10.0.1.4 networks).</p>

<p>A browser window should automatically pop up on xchange-box.com in a web browser. The login info for this page is saved, in case not the u is dcaptain and p is 10041234.</p>

<p>Once logged in, the home page not very useful. If you go to the &quot;Box Settings&quot; tab and look under &quot;Accounts&quot;, you can see the machine accounts and if they are online or not.</p>

<p>Marlink set up the machine IP of 10.0.1.2 for the Peplink for us. In mid-July 2021 I created myself the machine IP for the satcomms fitlet of 10.0.1.3. I did this in Box Settings &gt; Account &gt; Users &gt; Add. Username set to atsatcomms, user group set to machine, and ip address set to 10.0.1.3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To connect to the GX ACUs:</p>

<p>Plug into Port (master) or Stbd (slave) ACU at the lone ethernet port on the left side of the ACU. The IP of both of these is 192.168.2.1.</p>

<p>Set Marlink Laptop to static ip 192.168.2.2, subnet prefix 28, gateway 192.168.2.1, DNS 8.8.8.8.</p>

<p>Open the &quot;Aptus GX&quot; icon on the Marlink Laptop Desktop, login credentials u: intellian p: 12345678</p>

<p>This will get you to all of the ACU info, blockage zones, which antenna is active, GPS and heading coming in, Az &amp; El, etc etc etc</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get into the XFX (bottom) box:</p>

<p>Plug Marlink laptop into port 6 (NOT port 7 or 8 as the info sheet provided by marlink says) on the XFX (bottom) box. Set laptop IP to 192.168.50.10, prefix 28, gw 192.168.50.1, dns 8.8.8.8.</p>

<p>Open a browser to 192.168.50.1. Login u user and p fxuser.</p>

<p>This page does not give you a ton of useful info beyond if data is going through FB or GX, if the modem is up, if FB antenna is tracking or not, that kind of stuff.</p>
