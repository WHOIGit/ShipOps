========================================
<p>Sipura VOIP phone in main passageway was found not working 12 April 2017 (had been working week prior). Could no longer even connect to it via network to check settings (no blinky lights on either end even though power going into unit).</p>
<p>Pulled old main lab no-name VOIP out from closet to replace it, found that to be dead also. Could no longer connect to it via network to check settings, LCD display on phone dead as well.</p>
<p>Pulled brand new &quot;High Performance Ethernet Phone&quot; out of closet and configured based on settings saved from the dead VOIP phones.</p>
<p>Installed 13 April 2017, tested WHOI extensions and 1800 numbers, all functioning ok.</p>
<p>Password for web config interface stored in password file.</p>
<p>Web Config pages left on defaults except for pages attached here. *****NOTE: These config pages show the phone configured for 3131. The phone is actually configured for 3130 right now, so the user, passwords, phone number, etc where it says 3131 in this document should just be substituted as 3130.</p>
