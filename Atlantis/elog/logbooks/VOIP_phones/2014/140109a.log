========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I tested both VOIP phones.&nbsp; Both logged on fine and I was able to reach them and log onto the administrative account using the generic password (i.e. Sippura phone I had to logon as user and then select admin logon, but got on fine).&nbsp; I then called a couple WHOI extensions and got through to message machines.&nbsp; So, both are presently working.</span></p>
