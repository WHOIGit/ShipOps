========================================
<p>
<p>Removed the Computer Lab ESE clock and replaced it with one in which the  50% pulse has been inverted.&nbsp; This to provide proper 1pps pulse for the  multibeam.&nbsp; (the clock used for this is the one previously pulled from the top lab.)&nbsp; This clock is not presently used for the multibeam, but is used for other things.&nbsp; So it's really a spare as far as the multibeam is concerned.</p>
<p>Expl:&nbsp; Normal 185A ESE clock has a 1pps pulse that rises at the start  of the second.&nbsp; The EM122 needs a pulse that falls at the start of the  second.&nbsp; ESE supplied us with special firmware that does that. </p>
