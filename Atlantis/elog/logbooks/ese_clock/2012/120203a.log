========================================
<p>Removed the Top Lab ESE clock and replaced it with one in which the 50% pulse has been inverted.&nbsp; This to provide proper 1pps pulse for the multibeam.</p>
<p>Expl:&nbsp; Normal 185A ESE clock has a 1pps pulse that rises at the start of the second.&nbsp; The EM122 needs a pulse that falls at the start of the second.&nbsp; ESE supplied us with special firmware that does that.&nbsp; Installed new chip in clock, tested, seems to be fine, EM122 seems to be fixed.</p>
