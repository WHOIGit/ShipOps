========================================
<p>Old ESE Clock (one in place for past several years that had specially modified PPS pulse) was started displaying the wrong day of the year during at38.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clock was swapped out at WHOI on 01 Oct 2017 for a clock that did not have specially modified pulse.</p>

<p>PPS settings in Phins and EM122 changed accordingly.</p>
