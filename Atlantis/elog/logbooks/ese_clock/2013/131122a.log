========================================
<p>The old dead antenna for the top lab ese clock was removed in Sept 2013 from its mount above top lab. The entire pass through/rox blox that its cable ran through needs to be replaced during the next shipyard, as it is so corroded/painted over that it is essentially unusable. Should be a new gooseneck-type one.</p>
