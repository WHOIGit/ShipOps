========================================
<p>When deck testing following 1st cast to 1000m, found low voltage.&nbsp; Went to change battery and found about an inch of water in the housing.&nbsp; (when flat)&nbsp; Replaced battery housing with spare housing from OSU and other battery from URI, but still not working. &nbsp; Pulled out spare underwater unit from OSU, still not working. &nbsp; Turns out, (lucky for science), that one of the Sentry techs, (Al Duester), actually built the boards for the MOCNESS.&nbsp; After many hours of work, Al repaired the underwater unit, the aux underwater unit and the deck box.&nbsp; (yes, all three were damaged)&nbsp; I would appear that if power gets to the signal cable, (via seawater), bad things happen.&nbsp; In the course of all this we also tried the spare deck box, it was ALSO not working, it had a loose wire.&nbsp; Al fixed this as well.&nbsp;</p>

========================================
<p>Found bad cable on Oxygen sensor.&nbsp; Cable has not yet failed,but is starting to crack at the junction of the &quot;Pi&quot; plug and the wire.&nbsp; Might be repairable.&nbsp; Removed for now, since science does not care and it was quick.&nbsp; Also, it's not our cable.</p>
