========================================
<p>The Mochness stopped working at about 1200 meters of depth.&nbsp; Similar to last time, it had a big voltage drop, voltage went red, then it shut down.&nbsp; Could not restart it.&nbsp; Error message was shorted sea cable or just could not connect to underwater unit. &nbsp; Brought it back up.&nbsp; Somewhere between ~1000 - ~500 meter we were able to restart it.&nbsp; Fault seems most likely to be a bad cable getting squashed under pressure.&nbsp; Battery dropped about .2 volts while it was &quot;off&quot;.</p>
