========================================
<p>Copy of email to Laura regarding one of the Comm Ports on ftp not working (the one that should be /dev/ttyS0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fixed the .minirc. files so they match up.&nbsp; So, it is still <br />
&gt;minicom hiseasnet&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
to get to the Cisco 2900 (that is presently in charge).&nbsp; However, at2 is&nbsp; <br />
plugged into what I assume to be /dev/ttyS0 and I can't talk to it.&nbsp; It&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
works in a different device (meaning it is not the router).&nbsp; I tried <br />
plugging a different router into /dev/ttyS0 and got nothing.&nbsp; I also tried<br />
putting in a gps string and using minicom and then using the &quot;screen&quot; <br />
command and got nothing.&nbsp; In other words, I think that Comm Port is not&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
working (I have identified the other comm port device names- /dev/ttyS1,&nbsp; <br />
/dev/ttyS2, /dev/ttyS3).&nbsp; Is there something else it could be calling <br />
itself?&nbsp; Or, do we need to change the card when we get a chance?<br />
<br />
