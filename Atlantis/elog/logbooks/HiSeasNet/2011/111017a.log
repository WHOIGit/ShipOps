<p><span style="font-size: large;">ALARM CABLE REMOVED TO SOLVE flickering TX light problem!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;EMAIL TRAIL - Oct 12, 2011 - Oct 17, 2011</p>
<p>We were having trouble with the TX light one the modem suddenly going out (actually, the problem was that the TX was turning off) and flickering, etc.&nbsp; After many tests, etc.&nbsp; Steve theorized that it had to do with the pinning in the Alarm cable (see email explaining purpose of alarms cable):</p>
<p>Excerpt 1:</p>
<p>The alarm port has a pinout and description in the comtech manual. Its a way for external<br />
gear to see when the modem is locked up or not, affect transmission, etc. via pin closures.<br />
Not rocket science, but subscribes to some common equipment interfaces so these things can<br />
all work in data centers and/or with other equipment. The alarm port is kinda a misnomer,<br />
sort of, for this piece of equipment. I guess &quot;alarm&quot; ports are more commonly used for<br />
hardware-level alarm notices for other types of gear.</p>
<p>Excerpt 2:</p>
<p>Im wondering if your antenna is actually doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing. Im<br />
not sure if you are aware of it (guess I assumed you were, but maybe not), but the DAC is<br />
configured to tell the modem (through that alarms port) to stop transmitting when the<br />
antenna is pointing between headings of 340 and 357 relative to the ship. That's the mast.<br />
The logic is that the mast will block the signal, so (a) no need to transmit and (b) when<br />
you dont transmit, you also dont try to search...so when you are unblocked, the satellite<br />
comes back more quickly.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excerpt 3:</p>
<p>Warning...here comes some nitpicking. The devil is in the details, so bear with me as I try to<br />
explain. My apologies if you already know some of this, but I dont want to miss any steps.<br />
<br />
With a blackout zone set in the DAC, it will continue to function if it can see the satellite.<br />
If it loses track of the satellite, it wont search for it until it is again outside the<br />
blackout zone and still doesnt see it. That lets you turn through the blackout zone knowing the<br />
satellite is there, but you cant see it. When you come out of it, the antenna should be<br />
pointing were it expects the satellite to be. If it comes out of the blackout zone and cant<br />
quickly find the bird, it will search. It should NOT search for the satellite while in the<br />
blackout zone. The implication is that the system will still work if a blackout zone is setup,<br />
but the satellite never goes out of view or loses lock.<br />
<br />
The tricky bit comes in when the modem is connected to the DAC with blackout zones. When a<br />
blackout zone is encountered, one of the pins on that Gyro port flips. If that pin is then<br />
connected to the correct pin on the modem's alarm port, the modem should stop transmitting<br />
while in the zone (Rx light will stay lit, but Tx goes out). That's generally how we have set<br />
things up on some HSN ships that need the mute. This can be used to protect an area that might<br />
receive radiation when the antenna is pointed some particular direction. If your antenna is<br />
higher than anyone might be, you might consider disconnecting that cable between the modem and<br />
DAC.<br />
<br />
When setting a blackout zone with a mute, we try to cut it as close as possible to the actual<br />
cutouts as we can. So generally the edges are where the EbNo drops to about 1.5 or so. If you<br />
go too small of a zone, you lose the satellite and search before you enter the zone (and thus<br />
defeat the point of the zone). If you make it too big, you mute too early. The idea is to mute<br />
at a time when your signal is bad enough that you wouldnt see it anyways. Since this zone<br />
varies by elevation, it may need adjusting as the elevation angle changes.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;bad headings&quot;, there are really 2 different kinds. There are the ones where the modem<br />
has been muted by the DAC (see above) and the ones where there is actually an obstruction, but<br />
it may not be in the muted zone. There are a lot of headings that are bad for many reasons that<br />
dont involve muting (and they vary by elevation most times).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may also be an offset between azimuth and the heading depending on things like satellite<br />
reference mode and any modem offsets. As a result, the connection between a muted heading and<br />
the reported heading of the ship can sometimes vary a bit.<br />
<br />
I guess what Im getting at is that when the Tx light does blink out, please check the REL value<br />
on the DAC (not just the Az or heading of the ship). Maybe take a note of what it is.<br />
<br />
With all that said, Im still assuming that cable between the DAC and modem is a mute cable. It<br />
could very well do something else (hard to tell without pinouts). The test described earlier<br />
should confirm this. If you do have a mute cable, consider why you have one.<br />
