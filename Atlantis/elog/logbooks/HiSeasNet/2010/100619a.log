========================================
<p>We experienced a hiseasnet outage on 18 June 2010 from about 2:30 pm local time to about 5:30 pm local time.&nbsp; Initially, the outage was thought to be part of a upgrade/repair process being carried out by Steve Foley.&nbsp; As it turned out, he did not do anything to the system (had not found time to do his repair/upgrade).&nbsp; Initially the system lost tracking to the satellite.&nbsp; Just prior to about 4 pm, the tracking returned - we had 4 green lights.&nbsp; When the internet did not come back, we began to investigate.&nbsp; For some reason, the back-up email system was not working either.</p>
<p>EMAIL - we tried to run it manually, it appeared to hang.&nbsp; We were not getting through to Striker on either hiseasnet or FBB.&nbsp; We reset the FBB system.&nbsp; Still email did not run.&nbsp; We reboot Linus.&nbsp; After about 10 minutes, email started automatically (ecall), but it hung again.&nbsp; Catie did some work untar and retarring to see if the tar file that was present was preventing the transfer from continuing successfully.&nbsp; Email finally ran successfully.</p>
<p>Hiseasnet - we emailed Steve via webmail on FBB and determined that he had not done anything to the system.&nbsp; He could still see us.&nbsp; We checked all of the hiseasnet settings in the DAC, Codan, etc.&nbsp; everything looked fine, and we had not received any antenna errors.&nbsp; We reboot ftp (having already reboot Linus) and determined that ftp itself was definitely not connecting.&nbsp; We restarted the Cisco router.&nbsp; I believe this is the last thing we did before hiseasnet came back.&nbsp; At least 10 minutes went by after the router was reset, but then hiseasnet returned.&nbsp; We were not watching &quot;ON LINE&quot; light on the satellite modem, so it is indeterminate whether resetting the Cisco router was actually what solved the problem, or whether the system came back as mysteriously as it went out.</p>
