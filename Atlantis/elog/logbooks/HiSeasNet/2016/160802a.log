========================================
<p>swapped out the levelcage because of suspicious behavior.&nbsp; System seemed to be drifting in elevation at times, also would not stay pointed at the satellite when tracking was off.&nbsp; (drifted down.)&nbsp; New cage seems to be working fine, but we need to see it work for a while to be sure.</p>
