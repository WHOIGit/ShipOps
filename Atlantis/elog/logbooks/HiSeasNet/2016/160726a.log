========================================
<p>Rotated the feed from Transmit Left Hand to Transmit Right Hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Added inline amplifier to transmit line.&nbsp; This will be removed when we go back to a normal setup with hiseasnet.&nbsp; (modem does not have enough output to drive the BUC to full output by itself.)</p>

========================================
<p>Some DAC changes for Van Dover cruise.&nbsp; Some of these are for the cruise, other are permanent.</p>
<p>-Dishscan type changed from 133 to 129.&nbsp; (Better tracking based on Karls observations.)&nbsp; (this is a &quot;permanent&quot; change)</p>
<p>-New trim values.&nbsp; Old ltrim was -0009, new is 0006.&nbsp; Old az trim was -0019, new is 0001 (this is a &quot;permanent&quot; change)</p>
<p>-New tracking frequency is 0963MHz, old was 1005MHz.&nbsp; (this is only for the Van Dover cruise.&nbsp; It should be set back when the antenna feed is rotated back.)</p>
<p>-Auto threshold was found off.&nbsp; Tried to make it work, but it does not seem to work well.&nbsp; Left the system setup with manual threshold set to 1600.&nbsp; Present AGC at the dock in WHOI is 1810.&nbsp; (This is a &quot;permanent&quot; change.)</p>
