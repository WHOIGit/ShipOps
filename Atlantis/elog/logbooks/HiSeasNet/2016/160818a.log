<p><span style="font-size: large;">It is suggested we need a cable run from radome to modem&nbsp; - LMR600 due to poor signal level</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Part of a Slack conversation about the modem signal level on the Atlantis:</span><br />

2:32 PM yes - so for now @aheater do not change anything.&nbsp; We can go the -30 if need be.<br />

2:32 PM The signal level reported by Atlantis modem is consistently 20dB lower than ideal: https://hiseasnet.ucsd.edu/g5551ca5e/chart/%20%24%7BrxSignalLevel%7D%20for%20modem-ship-atlantis/*chart.png?timescale=monthly&amp;width=1920&amp;height=1080 (14KB)<br />

2:32 PM okay - so basically there is nothing I can do right now.<br />
jmeyer<br />
2:34 PM It will work in this manner, but getting that signal toward -35dBm, with good signal:noise (Eb/N0) would help HiSeasNet work better.&nbsp; Its a second order tune we recommend<br />
2:35<br />
I believe you can look at the modem&rsquo;s event logs in the UI and see the warnings.<br />
aheater<br />
2:39 PM okay.<br />
jmeyer<br />
2:39 PM Unfortunately, it means either dragging LMR600 from mast to Lab, or relocating HiSeasNet's modem closer to the mast and using LMR400.&nbsp; Neither is very quick or fun to do.&nbsp; :confused:<br />
kwalsh<br />
2:40 PM @aheater: will monitor for now from show<br />
2:40<br />
thanks for your help<br />
aheater<br />
2:40 PM we have a long transit coming up in a few weeks.&nbsp; Maybe it is something we could consider trying to do at that time.<br />
2:40<br />
thank you Kevin.<br />
jmeyer<br />
2:41 PM I&rsquo;d talk with lstolp and figure out if you want to/can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d recommend it.&nbsp; We did see a ~1dB Eb/N0 boost by simply getting the signal closer to ideal for other ships.<br />
aheater<br />
2:41 PM I will try to look into the cable runs (length), etc. and see if it is conceiveable<br />
2:41<br />
and yes, I'll talk to Laura<br />
lstolp<br />
2:41 PM awesome, thanks all<br />
aheater<br />
2:42 PM and see what she thinks<br />
jmeyer<br />
2:42 PM LMR600 is *thick* and the bend radius is big.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done that run on REVELLE.&nbsp; It will be an adventure if you do it. :wink:<br />
2:42<br />
&hellip;but probably worth it.<br />
aheater<br />
2:43 PM I love a good adventure !<br />
kwalsh<br />
2:43 PM Or you can use multimode fire and do a RF over Fiber Intefacility link<br />
jmeyer<br />
2:43 PM Oh, that&rsquo;s right!<br />
2:44<br />
That&rsquo;s much easier, cable-pulling wise<br />
2:44<br />
&hellip;but more electronics to diagnose<br />
aheater<br />
2:45 PM I will pass on the info. and see where we might go with it ...<br />
2:45<br />
I better go check on some scientists!<br />
jmeyer<br />
2:45 PM Let us know if we can help advise.&nbsp; Best wishes!<br />
aheater<br />
2:46 PM will do!<br />
thanks for all teh help<br />
2:46<br />
the<br />
2:46<br />
Bye for now!<br />
kwalsh<br />
2:46 PM We will be testing some RF over fiber units pretty soon and will report out.<br />
2:46<br />
more later - takereasy</p>
