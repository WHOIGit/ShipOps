========================================
<p>The BUC ( one of the fifty or so names for the Advantech 150 watt amp) is in a cardboard and wood box in the science hold.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A copy of the software was requested via email on 2017-01-20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update<br />
<br />
Hugo Sanchez from Comm Systems went aboard the Atlantis on 27 - 29 Dec.<br />
<br />
Hugo and HSN did the following:<br />
<br />
* installed variable gain in-line amp on Tx side<br />
* adjusted gain on Tx in-line amp to be able to set the L band modem output power to -22, which give us room to adjust<br />
* installed variable gain in-line amp on Rx side<br />
* installed new N connector style L band splitter on Rx side for Spec An<br />
* installed new LMR-400 with N connectors interconnect cables for equipment in the rack<br />
* Tested whole system, giving attention to DAC tracking frequencies<br />
* Adjusted L band output on ship modem to achieve shore EbNo about 6.0 dB that is in balance with carriers for the SKQ and Langseth.<br />
* Ship EbNo now 5.4 and warning for Rx signal below threshold is now cleared with in-line amp on Rx side as well =<br />
* with Rx in-line amp, now see - Local Modem Status<br />
Rx Demodulator Lock: on (1)<br />
Rx Eb/N0: 5.69 dB<br />
Rx Es/N0: 6.80 dB<br />
Rx Freq Offset: 345.71 Hz<br />
Rx Signal Level: -43.1 dBm<br />
Rx Composite Power Level: -23.0 dBm<br />
AUPC Power Offset: 0.00 dB<br />
Temperature: 43.00&deg;C (109.40&deg;F)<br />
<br />
WAS seeing - &nbsp;Rx signal below threshold. Threshold: -53, Current: -57.9357<br />
<br />
Intermapper messages and warnings for Atlantis gone - all Green.<br />
<br />
Spec An carrier looks pretty - see Atlantis on the right -<br />
Inline image 1Hugo secured in-line amps in the cabinet.<br />
<br />
HSN saved ship modem configuration as &ldquo;modem_ship_atlantis_28122016&quot;<br />
<br />
Sea Tel DAC parameters attached.<br />
<br />
Also, the spares list as Hugo gathered.<br />
<br />
On the spares list, I do not see the spare Advantech 150 watt amp, HSN asset ID 001079. Please make sure you all know where that is at,<br />
and that you have the Advantech software installed on a team use laptop.<br />
<br />
Muchas gracias por tu ayuda&#8203;,&#8203;<br />
