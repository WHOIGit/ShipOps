<p>THere is a GPS Feed going to &quot;remote&quot; serial port on paradise modem</p>
<p>EMAIL 18-JUL-2016</p>
<p>Hello Atlantis folks.<br />
<br />
When you all get a chance, can you let us know if you all can wire up a serial GPS feed for the satellite modem is<br />
possible by the end of the week (if you have not done it already)?<br />
<br />
We need it for the Van Dover cruise.<br />
<br />
You can source it from a ship PNT feed or from the DAC. &nbsp;DAC source info below.<br />
<br />
Goes to the DB-9 female to right of Rx connector.<br />
<br />
Technical details below with the pin assignments.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dave S. apparently wired this up</p>
