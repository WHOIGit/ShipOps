========================================
<p>Ship was not online.&nbsp; First problem was just retargeting.&nbsp; Still no traffic being passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, no transmit carrier light.&nbsp; Thinking that this might be related the the recent frame size changes, (which were then undone), looked at frame size for TX.&nbsp; Changed it from short to normal.&nbsp; This allowed transmitting to take place.&nbsp; However it did not allow us to pass data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Switched back to short, (which is the correct setting), and we are now able to pass traffic.&nbsp; Spoke to Kevin about this and it's not out of the question for the modem to go wonky.</p>
