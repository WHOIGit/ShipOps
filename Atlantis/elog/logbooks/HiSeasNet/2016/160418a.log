========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">EQUIPMENT / ANTENNA UPGRADE - More &quot;power&quot; capability - Karl Kapusta came to Charleston Shipyard to perform upgrade</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">SUMMARY:&nbsp;&nbsp; ******I (Allison) need to clarify some items with Karl K ************<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The HSN antenna was upgraded due to the at33-04 NTSB cruise that includes telepresence.&nbsp; The equipment was required for this cruise, so the opportunity arose to upgrade some pieces permanently in preparation for the trend toward more and more telepresence,&nbsp; The upgrades will allow for more power capabilities (when funding is available).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Equipment that has been upgraded and replaced permanently includes (this list need to be verified by Karl K.):&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">DAC's:&nbsp; (NEW:&nbsp; DAC-2202 &amp; DAC-2200 - operate at L-Band);&nbsp; Old DAC's:&nbsp; DAC-2302 and the DAC-03 will be sent back (they only work at 70 MHz and your new RF works at L-Band) </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">BUC (Block Up Converter - replaced the CODAN&nbsp;&nbsp; {Power consumption ranges from 40W to a maximum of 300W - I pulled this out of the modem manual, because it seemed of interest}), </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">LNB (Low Noise Block) - replaced the LNA</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Equipment which is temporary for this cruise (will be removed at WHOI in May 2016):</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CDM-625 Satellite Modem - RETURN TO VERIZON - being used in place of our Q-flex teledyne modem (there are two in the rack, one is spare)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Linear Feed - in place of our circular feed - the linear feed is a &quot;US&quot; only type feed used by Verizon;&nbsp; our normal feed works globally</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><cite>NOTE:&nbsp; a wave flange from our circular feed was removed and used in mounting the linear feed (pictures attached)<br />
</cite></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">URI 3800 Series Cisco Router - not really part of the &quot;antenna equipment&quot; (included because it is mounted in our rack and don't want to overlook removing)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The equipment was installed and configured (DAC and modem settings are in attached Word documents).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">POWER TO ANTENNA/RADOME:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was also the issue of differing power requirements (CODAN to BUC change) to the new antenna system.&nbsp; Our present inverters are not rated or sufficient to supply the required power.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The antenna is being powered off of the 220 Volt supply (originally run for the AC system - AC still on same).&nbsp; The present configuration is not on UPS or battery back-up of any kind.&nbsp; There is a 20 Amp breaker on one of the pedestal legs feeding the system.&nbsp; The breaker in the pedestal base is now a 15 Amp breaker.&nbsp; This feeds a new 220 Volt power ring in the dish.&nbsp; Some of the configurations needs to be clarified (i.e. better details in this documentation)<br />
