========================================
<p>During initial setup of this cruise everything looked right in the modem configuration.&nbsp; Kevin could connect to the modem over satellite, but we could not communicate with the modem or beyond from the local side.&nbsp; Both the modem and c2900 reported the link was up, and MAC addresses were exchanged between the devices, but no IP traffic would pass (not even ping).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution was:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save modem configuration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOAD DEFAULTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reload the saved configuration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot modem</p>
<p>Looks like this procedure clears memory errors when significant changes are made to the configuration.</p>
