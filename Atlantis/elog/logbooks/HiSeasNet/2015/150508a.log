========================================
<p>A new battery charger has been installed in the doghouse and the hiseasnet antenna is hooked back up to the battery system.&nbsp; The manual for the new charger is in the hiseasnet directory on sssg_on_memory (EQUIPMENT/hiseasnet_fbb/hiseasnet/battery_charger_doghouse/ManualCM1_090831EN.pdf</p>
<p>&nbsp;The battery charger is also hooked to the 3PS system so it no longer goes down if/when we lose ship's power</p>
