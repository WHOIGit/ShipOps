========================================
HighSeasNet failed on Saturday, April 25, although we did not notice in until Monday.  (ship is at the dock) 
Basic symptom is weak receive signal, low agc, which in turn causes other issues like lack of tracking.  

Talked to Steve Foley, swapped out the converter in the dome.  (installed a used but good spare.)  Seemed to
work a little bit better, but still not good at all.  EbNo around 2, tops.  Tried a brand new converter, this
actually did not seem as good as the UBG spare, so put the UBG spare back in.  Still the same.

Swapped out the LNA, no improvement at all.  

Ship left the dock, still not working.
