========================================
<p>Annual visit from Karl Kapusta.&nbsp; No major issue prior to visit, so just normal maintenance.</p>
<p>Noted that talking to the Codan from the computer lab failed.&nbsp; Also noted that the cabling was &quot;backwards&quot; for the two FSK modems.&nbsp; (DAC was using the Tr line and Codan was using the Rcv line.&nbsp; This is backwards, although it works fine this way.)&nbsp; Swapped the data lines above and below, problem followed the FSK modems.&nbsp; (could not talk to the Codan, but now the DAC has no comms.)&nbsp; Replaced the lower FSK modem in the Rcv line, this fixed the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swapped out the DAC97 for newer DAC03 (from Knorr)&nbsp; DAC03 performs better, is more up-to-date, and is easier to drive.&nbsp; No problems were encountered in this swap.&nbsp; Left the DAC97 in the rack as a ready spare.&nbsp;&nbsp; Old, spare DAC97 was found to have bad display, removed from ship.</p>
<p>Verified that data collector will work with DAC03 (vs DAC97) and checked that it was collecting data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left a DAC2203 on board as a deep spare.&nbsp; This unit is NOT configured at this time.&nbsp; Long term, pedestal will be replaced with newer, more modern one, DAC97 will be removed and DAC03 and DAC2203 will be on board.&nbsp; Newer pedestal is capable, (with upgrades), of Ku band operation, present pedestal is not.</p>
<p>Minor re-balancing done on antenna.</p>

<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did you repower the modem at some point? If so Steve needs to put a route back in (he has the M&amp;C) to point<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; traffic back to the cisco router.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, numerous times.<br />

Hi Laura<br />
<br />
Yes, it's all good.<br />
<br />
We got Jon back on the phone after his lunch and he put a bunch of configuration back in.&nbsp; There may have also been<br />
some &quot;normal&quot; mistakes.&nbsp; I think there was at least one bad cut/paste on Jon's end.&nbsp; Final result is that the new<br />
firmware is in, and it will now carry the routes and stuff through a reset.<br />
<br />
We also worked out a few other issues.&nbsp; The new dish is about 10db better than the old one.&nbsp; Turns out that it's<br />
possible to send to much power to the modem.&nbsp; It also turns out that the error messages on the panel of the modem<br />
are incomplete, so we missed the cause of the error for a while.&nbsp; We saw &quot;Signal strength is to low&quot;, but if we had<br />
used the web interface, we would have seen &quot;Signal strength is to low or to high&quot;.&nbsp; We ended up putting a 6db<br />
attenuator in the lead to the modem.&nbsp; (we can attenuate the receive signal in the dome, but then the DAC also gets<br />
attenuated, and it like the full signal.)<br />
