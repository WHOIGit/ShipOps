========================================
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Use the program &quot;<strong>ProgTerm</strong>&quot; - as of Oct 2015 this was loaded on Neptune and the DAC was plugged via serial cable into Comm 5</span></p>

========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Cruise at31-a - the first cruise after the rebuilt antenna was installed&gt;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Please see the email trail from Oct. 11 to the 18th (and maybe beyond) for detailed descriptions of the issues / symptoms we were seeing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">BASIC SUMMARY OF PROBLEM:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: large;">Antenna not tracking properly.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: large;">Signal on spectrum analyzer fluctuating wildly when antenna is pointed at the satellite and the ship is at specific headings:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Ship Heading 253-341 degrees</li>
        <li>Antenna Relative Heading 173-260 degrees</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Rx Traffic light going out and AGC fluctuating wildly (low when light is out) at the above mentioned relative headings</li>
    <li>Antenna tracking wrong satellite</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the cruise, the antenna seemed to be working fine at all relative headings (or at least the ones we hit within the above mentioned range).&nbsp; There were still some ongoing symptoms though, and no problems had been found and repaired.&nbsp; Karl K. was away, but arranged for Hugo Sanchez Lopes to come from Mexico City (been working for Comm Systems down there for 12 years).</p>
<p>****************SUMMARY OF HUGO'S VISIT:<br />
Hugo arrived yesterday morning and spent the day going through every connection and setting for the antenna and DAC, etc.&nbsp; Since we<br />
are at the dock, we, of course, could not really duplicate all the issues.<br />
<br />
In summary, this is what we did:<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Replaced Rotary Joint (Hugo was not convinced that this was necessary as we had not seen Comm errors, but there were still some<br />
other symptoms pointing to the rotary joint, so we changed it).<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; Rebalanced the antenna.&nbsp; The antenna was found to be slightly out of balance when pointed at the relative positions where we<br />
were having problems.&nbsp; A single small weight was added, and the antenna was in good balance in all directions then.<br />
<br />
3)&nbsp; Hugo changed the DAC so that it will be tracking the frequency of a different, stronger signal on the same satellite.&nbsp; This<br />
seems to have alleviated the issue of the DAC jumping into search and ending up on the wrong satellite.&nbsp; So, the SYS TYPE was also<br />
changed back to &quot;0015&quot; (so, IF Freq = 56.80 MHz and SYS TYPE = 0015)<br />
<br />
4)&nbsp; Hugo recommended we run in Satellite Reference Mode.&nbsp; So, we made that setting change in the DAC, and will use it as our<br />
default.<br />
<br />
5)&nbsp; Hugo ran power tests.<br />
<br />
6)&nbsp; When checking cables, Hugo changed the position of the RX Attenuator (it is now at the other end of the cable, as that end is<br />
removed and connected less often (it was a tad loose, he moved it and tightened it up).<br />
<br />
Overall, he went through the system top to bottom and could not find anything else wrong.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we can only test the<br />
system at one heading while at the dock.&nbsp; However, worth noting, is the fact that after Karl K. left after the rebuild, the antenna<br />
stopped tracking the satellite at this same dock position.&nbsp; From the time I arrived on Oct. 9th until we sailed on Oct. 11 it did<br />
not track.&nbsp; I was told, at the time, that we were getting interference from a land based installation.&nbsp; In retrospect, this was<br />
probably inaccurate information.&nbsp; At any rate, the antenna is tracking well now, in the same dick position at the same heading (that<br />
is a good sign as far as I am concerned).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be shipping the rotary joint that was removed to Comm Systems for testing.<br />
<br />
We will not be sailing now until tomorrow (some science equipment delays - but fortunately no delays from our side).&nbsp; Once we get<br />
off shore, I will give you an update as to how things are going.&nbsp; We are going back to the same general area, so we should know<br />
pretty quickly whether there are still gremlins present.<br />
<br />
We received the new FSK multiplexer.&nbsp; I also grabbed the AZ encoder and the used rotary joint left over from the rebuild and<br />
brought them on the ship as spares, as per Karl's recommendation.<br />
