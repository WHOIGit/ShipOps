========================================
<p>Added UPS to the dome to supply power to the antenna, since the existing homebrew UPS system has failed.&nbsp; Still need to route the power to the dome somewhat better.&nbsp; Eventual plan is to change to a canister that does not need a UPS.&nbsp; (one that has built in brakes.)</p>
