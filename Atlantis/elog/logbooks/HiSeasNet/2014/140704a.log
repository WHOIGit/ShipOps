<p>Has some weird problems with EbNo going up/down and power along with it.&nbsp; Called Karl, since we were in port, he found a bad connector in the equipment shack for the transmitter.&nbsp; He swapped the cable for the time being.&nbsp; This happened around June 16th.&nbsp; While this was going on, we also had some scrolling com errors, where the error number climb at about 10/sec.&nbsp; This cleared up on it's own before it could be diagnosed.</p>

<p>Scrolling com errors returned with a vengence.&nbsp; Turned out to be a bad FSK modem.&nbsp; Swapped the 422 serial lines top/bottom, this did not fix it.&nbsp; Then swapped lower modems, still not fix.&nbsp; Then swapped the two 422 lines back to their original positions, this fixed it.&nbsp; This suggests that both top and bottom modem are bad. &nbsp;&nbsp; Need to get replacement modems from Steve.&nbsp;&nbsp; This all happened around June 19th.</p>

<p>Around June 22 lost connection to shore.&nbsp; Satellite like still up and looking good, seems like a routing issue.&nbsp; Got a hold of Steve, seems like something was wrong with the accelerator.&nbsp; (even though we don't have one, we still go through the one on shore.)&nbsp; Steve did some reconfiguring and now all is well.&nbsp; This accelerator is going to be removed in the not too distant future.</p>

========================================
<p>Swapped from AOR to POR.&nbsp; No problems.&nbsp; Here are the changes:</p>
<p>New Satellite is 183E<br />
DAC IF 75.910 (75 MHz and 0910 KHz)<br />
<br />
Codan Tx: 6240<br />
<br />
Comtech Rx: 75.9100 MHz, <br />
Comtech Tx: 76.2050 MHz,<br />
</p>
<p>Power in the Comtec modem was set to -20, (which is the limit.&nbsp; If we need to cut it back any more, it will have to be done in the dome.)</p>

<p>Noticed that the connection was reallyyyyy sllooooowwwww.&nbsp; Not so unusual.&nbsp; However traffic was not maxxed out, so WTF?&nbsp; While looking at the traffic levels, also happened to glance at the &quot;error&quot; graph for the serial port, something I usually never look at.&nbsp; There were lots of errors.&nbsp; I then noticed that the EbNo was about 2.3, which suck, and was clearly the source of the errors on the serial port.&nbsp; But why is the EbNo low?&nbsp; Pattern on the spec is clearly getting soft, so must be tracking issue.&nbsp; System does not seem to be peaking well.&nbsp; Turned off tracking for about a second, then turned it back on again.&nbsp; Antenna returned to a better spot and stayed there.&nbsp; Still fine 24 hours later, but I don't know why it did this.&nbsp; Looking the history of serial errors, this appears to be a developing problem over the last month or so, although there are&nbsp; some serial errors on and off for a long time.</p>
