========================================
<p>*******UPDATE TO BELOW&nbsp; - skip the part between the stars for now - I will redo this in port in a few days ...</p>

<p>I set the ip address in the DAC to 199.92.161.186&nbsp;&nbsp; - it can now be accessed via the browser (seatel, 1234)&nbsp; as well as DACRemP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>settings were cahnged using progterm - which is still available on Neptune under ProgramFiles.&nbsp; The parameter dump from progterm is more comprehensive, I attached it (the one after the ip address change) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>*******</p>

<p>Current setup to access the DAC is via a serial connection from the SeaTel Cobham DAC to the Neptune server (grey serial cable located behind rack).</p>

<p>Use the KVM to get to Neptune and then open the DAC Remote Program. There is a shortcut on the desktop (icon is a globe).</p>

<p><u>To create a parameter dump:</u></p>

<p>Note: This option will only work as long as you are not actively logging.</p>

<p>Ctrl + D or click on [Tools] then select [Parameter Dump].</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>To create a log file:</u></p>

<p>Click on [File] located on the upper left.</p>

<p>Select [Start Data Log] from the drop down menu.</p>

<p>This will prompt you to name and save the log as a .csv file. There is an existing directory on the desktop called &quot;DAC_Logs&quot;.</p>

<p>To finish writing to the file, click on [File] then select [Close Data Log]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Examples of both output files attached.</p>
