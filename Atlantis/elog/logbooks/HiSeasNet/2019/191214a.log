========================================
<p><strong>Steps we need to complete to move the Atlantis HSN service to the new satellite.</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to get the Seatel antenna to find and track the new satellite, in this case Intelsat IS-23 at 53 degrees West Longitude. This is actually a twostep process. The first step is to set the DAC 2202 Controller to the correct RX Tracking frequency. The second step will then be to change the Satellite Longitude on the DAC to 53 degrees West. Once these DAC parameters are set, you can command the DAC to target the new satellite.</p>

<p><strong><u>To change the Tracking frequency on the DAC 2202, perform the following:</u></strong></p>

<p>First, press the &quot;Next&quot; button on the DAC front panel until the display screen shows the current Tracking frequency in the bottom left corner of the screen. Now press the &quot;Enter&quot; button three times, to highlight the Frequency. (Record this frequency for future use.)</p>

<p>12/14/19 frequency value: 1022 MHz</p>

<p>After recording the current numbers, use the Left and Right Arrow buttons on the DAC front panel to move the cursor under the desired digits, and use the Up and Down Arrows to change the digits to the correct new values. When you are finished, the Tracking Frequency on the DAC will be 1024 MHz. Now press the &quot;Enter&quot; button twice. The first time to set the new frequency in the DAC, and the second time to move to the next value.</p>

<p>After the second time, the front panel display will show one of two possible parameters. The first possibility is a 4-digit number labeled &quot;kHz&quot;. For example, it might say &quot;0326 kHz&quot;. If numbers are displayed, then use the left and right arrow buttons to move the cursor, and use the Up and Down arrows to make changes such that the new value will read &quot; 0491 kHz&quot;.</p>

<p>However, if the next screen shows a value labeled &quot;BAUD&quot;, then no further adjustments are required. For example, after pressing &quot;Enter&quot; a second time, the next screen will show a typical value of &quot;6000 BAUD&quot;. (This is just an example). If the value is labeled &quot;BAUD&quot;, that means the DAC is set to just use the primary frequency of 1024 MHz.</p>

<p><strong><u>To change the Satellite, perform the following steps..</u></strong></p>

<p>First, press the &quot;Next&quot; button until the Satellite Longitude is displayed in the top left corner of the DAC front panel display. (Record this number for future use.)</p>

<p>12/14/19 Longitude value: 180E</p>

<p>After recording the current value, press the &quot;Enter&quot; button one time to highlight this parameter. Now us the DAC front panel arrow buttons to change the current value to &quot;53 West&quot;. When the parameter is set to 53 W, press the &quot;Enter&quot; button twice. The first press will set the new value in the DAC memory. The second press will command the antenna to calculate the appropriate AZ and EL values for the new satellite and drive the antenna to this position and search for the bird. Hopefully the antenna will find the satellite and start tracking.</p>

<p><strong><u>Save the new Tracking Frequency and Satellite Longitude values</u></strong></p>

<p>First, press BOTH the Left and Right Arrows at the same time and hold for appx 6 seconds. The screen will now display &quot;Save Parameters&quot;. At this point. press the right arrow one time to display the cursor in the bottom right corner of the screen, and then press &quot;Enter&quot; one time. This saves the new values to the DAC.&nbsp; The DAC screen will respond with the message &quot;ParametersSaved&quot;.&nbsp; Now, press the &quot;Enter&quot; button until the front panel screen displays the message &quot;Remote Parameters&quot;. At this point press the Right arrow to display the cursor in the bottom right corner of the display, and then press &quot;Enter&quot;. The screen will again respond with the message &quot;Parameters Saved&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Recall the configuration file on the HSN modem</strong></p>

<p>Using the WebUI, go to EDIT then click the tab &quot;Memories&quot; and then &quot;Recall&quot;. The config for this IS-23 swap was saved as: modem_ship_atlantis_IS23G_12142019.&nbsp;</p>
