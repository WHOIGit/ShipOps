<p>The condensor fan fuse had failed and the display board rj45 connector at the control board was faulty.</p>

Steven from Aloha Marine fixed a connector and replaced a fuse on the
control board and reports that Dometic AC unit is now working.</pre>

<p><!--EndFragment-->Joe actually fixed the connector, re-terminated rj45 display cable.</p>

<p>We still don&#39;t know why the fuse failed.</p>
