LMR-600 is LMR-400 on steroids.

Size:
LMR-400   .405
LMR-600   .590

Bend Radius, one time only:
LMR-400   1&quot;
LMR-600   1.5&quot;

Bend radius, repeated:
LMR-400   4&quot;
LMR-600   6&quot;

Loss per 100&#39;
LMR-400   4.25 db
LMR-600   2.62 db

Everything else is pretty much the same between them.  The LMR-400 is  
a pretty standard size.  The main reason to use LMR-600 is because you  
need a low loss cable.

Now you might think that a lower loss cable is always better, but if  
you have a preamp at the location of a receiving antenna, low loss is  
actually not very important.  And for transmitting, you can just crank  
up the power until you have the level you need.  Personally, unless  
there was a real need, I&#39;d stick with LMR-400.
