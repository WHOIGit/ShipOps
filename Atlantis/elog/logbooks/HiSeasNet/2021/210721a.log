========================================
<p>Network to the ship of CKu:</p>

<p>If you set a laptop to DHCP, you should be connected to outside world internet via port 2 (or port 1 if you must) on the CKu Cisco router.</p>

<p>Port 1 on the CKu Cisco router is cabled to port 8 on sg20-1.</p>

<p>Port 8 sg20-1 is set to VLAN 12. Ports 9 and 10 are also on VLAN 12.</p>

<p>Port 9 sg20-1 is cabled to Peplink WAN2, Peplink static IP is 10.188.126.162, subnet 255.255.255.240, gw 10.188.126.161, dns 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1.</p>

<p>Port 10 sg20-1 is cabled to the satcomm fitlet interface enp1s0 with IP 10.188.126.163.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The phones are plugged into ports 3 and 4 on the CKu Cisco. Phones #s are 1-929-955-0380 and -0381. As of 7-21-21 they are only making outgoing calls and will not receive incoming calls, there should be an open ticket with Marlink.</p>

<p>In theory one day the phones could/should go on VLAN 7 to be patched through the backbone to the appropriate location.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Access to the innards of the CKu system is acheived by plugging into port 14 on the CKu cisco router.</p>

<p>Set Marlink laptop to IP 10.225.231.110, prefix 28, gw 10.225.231.97, dns 8.8.8.8.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get into Newtec modem, click &quot;newtec modem&quot; icon on desktop (or use ip above .97). &quot;Expert login&quot; is p s3p.</p>

<p>This portal tells you if modem is &quot;operational&quot;, can tell you info about dropped packets, EsNo and threshold, a little about the sat interface, that kind of stuff. Not much else.</p>

<p>The long and short is if you look at the front of the Newtec modem, if the power, rx, and tx lights are lit blue, things should be working, If they are not and the exclamation point light is lit, things are not working.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get to the CKu ACU, click Aptus CKu icon on the desktop. The communication popup window should already show IP: 10.225.231.98 port 4002. Just click the connect button.</p>

<p>The next popup is something that warns about &quot;the data volume may increase substantially in network communication mode&quot;. Click OK.</p>

<p>Next popup is for login, u intellian p 12345678.</p>

<p>Now you should be in the fun dashboard with all of the ACU info, GPS, heading, Az, El, graphs, all that good stuff.</p>
