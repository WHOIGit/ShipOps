========================================
<p>Replaced the cross-level and elevation bearings in the antenna.&nbsp; This was done primarily as a preventive maintenance measure, since other ships have been failing, but it turned that&nbsp; one of the cross-level bearings was very poor.&nbsp; Other bearings felt OK, but where oozing grease, which is just odd.&nbsp; </p>
