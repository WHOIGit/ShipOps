========================================
<p>Karl Kapusta here to check system, no major&nbsp; issues found.</p>
<p>Adjusted level cage tilt.&nbsp; Adjusted az/el trim values, (as must be done after tilt adjustment).&nbsp; Noted gyro was off, so system will need to be re-trimmed before departing.&nbsp; Use auto trim to reset. </p>
<p>Check the setting on the spare 2200 DAC, all are identical to in use DAC 2202.&nbsp; (Trim will probably need to be set,, 2200 does not have auto trim)</p>
