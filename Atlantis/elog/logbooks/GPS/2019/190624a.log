<p>Title:&nbsp;Cnav 3050&amp;#x2f;Cnavigator III RTCM output</p>

<p>Description:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello-</p>

<p>I have a CNav 3050 and CNavigator III with a valid corrections<br />
subscription. I am attempting to output RTCM info to a Kongsberg Seapath<br />
sensor. I enabled RTCM via the CNavigator III via Menu &gt; Port 3 (the port<br />
connected to my Kongsberg Seapath) &gt; Output Settings &gt; Output RTCM &gt; Yes.<br />
However, I have so far not had success getting the Seapath to recognize<br />
the RTCM from the CNav.</p>

<p>Is there a further step or setting other than that mentioned above<br />
necessary to enable the output of the RTCM messages from Port 3 of the<br />
CNavigator III?</p>

<p>When connecting to Port 3 via a terminal on a computer, is there something<br />
I should be seeing to verify the presence of the RTCM messages? I<br />
currently see nothing when connected via a terminal. I also see no 1Hz<br />
voltage oscillation on the Port 3 DB9 when solely outputting RTCM, that is<br />
present when I enable a standard NMEA message.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />

<p>Hi Catie,</p>

<p>It is recommended to output directly from the C-Nav3050 rather from the display. Do you have an available port on the<br />
C-Nav3050 to do this? May I know what RTCM message type that the Seapath is expecting?</p>

<p>When viewing RTCM messages in a terminal, it will not be legible but you should still see the gibberish as an indicator that<br />
it is in fact sending the messages.</p>

<p>Thanks and Best Regards,</p>

<p>Thank you Jacob for your reply.</p>

<p>I can free up a Com1 on the 3050 for the purpose of feeding the Seapath. However, it is not clear to me how to enable the<br />
output of RTCM messages from Com1. My choices in Menu &gt; CNav3050 &gt; Output Configuration &gt; Com1 seem to be limited to NMEA<br />
message types. I am unable to locate an option similar to that in Menu &gt; Port 3 &gt; Output Settings &gt; Other Output &gt; Output<br />
RTCM.</p>

<p>The Seapath specifies RTCM-SC104 v. 2.2, 2.3 and 3 as corrections inputs. An option exists within the Seapath HMI to input<br />
RTCM specifically from a CNav unit, and my Kongsberg service tech has assured me he has seen the CNav corrections input into<br />
the Seapath on other vessels.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />
Catie</p>

<p>Hi Catie,</p>

<p>You can select the RTCM message and output port on the Differential Configuration page. Since you are outputting the RTCM, you<br />
will want to choose Base RTCM in the drop list for&nbsp;Mode and Com1 for the&nbsp;Base Output Port. You will also need to set<br />
the&nbsp;Dynamic Mode to Dynamic if it is not already set to that.</p>

<p>Thanks and Best Regards,</p>

<p>&gt; Yes. I heard back from CNAV and they walked me through getting the messages out of the CNAV - some obscure settings in the<br />
&gt; differential corrections menu and then you must use one of the native com ports on the receiver.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; I was ready to give up on the Seapath when I found the trick is to tell the Seapath that it is not a CNav, just a generic<br />
&gt; receiver with generic RTCM messages, manufactured by CNav.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; Made new screenshots and exported a new configuration to document the settings.<br />
