<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>As a heads up, now that we have a new ECDIS, it would be extremely helpful for all waypoints to be sent to us using the file format<br />
attached. This way, we will be able to upload them directly and expedite the process. It will also limit the human error factor of typing<br />
in individual waypoints.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>-Amy<br />
