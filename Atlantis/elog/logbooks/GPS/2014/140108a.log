========================================
<p>Attached are scanned notes sheets from measurements of antenna positions after moves/installations.&nbsp; The main purpose of saving these is they are a good reference if something looks/seems &quot;odd&quot; with offsets, and also because I personally find it helpful to compare some of the &quot;non-changing&quot; measurements between various measurement events (i.e. measure top of rail to catwalk deck - measurement should come out the same each time in same location, and differences give an idea of the accuracy of the measurements).&nbsp; It is also helpful to have these measurements for locating the &quot;BM&quot; on the mast when the &quot;spot&quot; has worn off (the weld and photo are the best indicator probably, but the measurements help).</p>
