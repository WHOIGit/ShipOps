C-Nav Satellite Frequency Change<br />
<br />
Please be advised that C-Nav will be assigning new satellite frequencies to the C-Nav Corrections<br />
Service.&nbsp; This frequency change is necessary to move C-Nav signal services away from future lower-band<br />
satellite signals that might interfere with C-Nav in some locales.&nbsp; The first phase, scheduled to<br />
begin October 30, 2014, will include 4 satellites in the Net-2 constellation.&nbsp; The satellites affected<br />
are 54W, 15.5W, 64E, and 178E. The current frequencies will remain on the air until December 15, 2014<br />
to allow customers to transition to the new frequencies.&nbsp; C-Nav receivers tracking Net-1 corrections<br />
satellites will not be affected at this time.&nbsp; A similar announcement will be made at the appropriate<br />
time next year with details for phase 2 activity, which will include frequency changes for the<br />
remaining 3 Net-1 satellites.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The C-Nav correction quality will not be affected, but some degree of manual interaction may be<br />
required with your C-Nav GPS/GNSS systems so that the new frequencies can be used by the receiver. <br />
The following information provides transition actions required for this first phase activity. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;*&nbsp; C-Nav3050 receivers updated with current firmware will pick up the new CCS almanac over-the-air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and automatically tune to the new frequencies.&nbsp; Alternatively, the receiver can be manually tuned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use a new frequencies by following the instructions in the links included in this email.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;*&nbsp; Discontinued receivers (C-Nav2000, C-Nav2050, and C-Nav1010) do not support over-the-air CCS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; almanac updates and will need to be manually tuned to a new Net-2 frequency before December 15,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 to avoid losing C-Nav service.&nbsp; No action required at this time if using Net-1 service. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legacy C-Nav receivers can be manually tuned to use a new Net-2 frequency by following the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instructions in the links included in this email.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
The latest C-Nav controller software and C-Nav3050 firmware can be downloaded from the following<br />

Subject: QUESTION:&nbsp; [CNav-announce] C-Nav Satellite Frequency Change<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
I am on the R/V Atlantis.&nbsp; We have a 3050 (firmware 3.0.0 build 165).&nbsp; I went through the steps at<br />
faq.cnav.com for entering the new frequencies and ID's manually.&nbsp; I obtained &quot;LOCK&quot; on each of ID 447,<br />
485, 565, and 679.&nbsp; When I was finished, I noticed my list of satellites still contained all the old<br />
ones (446, 484, 564, 678 - which I'd expect, because it is not Dec. 15 yet), and only one of the new<br />
ones (the last one I entered).&nbsp; Is that because there is a limit to the number of satellites that can<br />
appear in the list?<br />
<br />
I guess my main quesiton is, how can I verify my entries are in there permanently?&nbsp; I tried updating<br />
the satellite list but did not see the other three new ones.&nbsp; Is there a second page to the satellite<br />
list I have simply missed?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help,<br />
