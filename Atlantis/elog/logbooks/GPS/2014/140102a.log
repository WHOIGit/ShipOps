========================================
<p>FROM email 2014-Jan-01:</p>
<p>The CNAV 3050 antenna is now mounted and up and running (Catie and I put it up this morning).&nbsp; We have attached<br />
pictures of the mount.&nbsp; This mount is meant to be temporary, but should last up to a year without a problem if we get<br />
stalled in getting one made.<br />
<br />
This mount is made from schedule 80 milled steel piping 2&quot; diameter.&nbsp; The U-bolts from the cnav3050 mount that came<br />
with the antenna have been tack welded to the piping by the Chief Engineer.&nbsp; The cnav mount was then attached to the<br />
U-bolts (316 SS).&nbsp; Our kind bosun/deck crew prepped and painted it for us.&nbsp; The piece of the old mounting pipe (the<br />
one that broke) that was screwed into the bottom of the CNAV 3050 antenna, was left screwed in.&nbsp; We wrapped it so it<br />
would not make contact with the inside of the milled steel pipe, increased the diameter in a few spots to prevent it<br />
from vibrating too much, and slipped it inside the milled steel pipe. The bottom of the 3050 antenna basically rests<br />
on top of the pipe (separated metal from metal by some gasket material).&nbsp; Then the antenna was bolted to the antenna<br />
mount (The bottom of the antenna has a circular ring of 10-32 bolt holes - two of these were used - see<br />
canv3050antenna2.jpg).&nbsp; In order to further support the antenna we attached a SS safety from the pipe mount to<br />
another of the bolt holes on the opposite side (there is a lot of vibration and wind up there).&nbsp; The overall length<br />
of pipe used is ~ 1.5 meters.<br />
<br />
The antenna was previously mounted outboard of the catwalk railing using SS brackets.&nbsp; Since we did not get any<br />
information regarding the spec's of these brackets, and because the schedule 80 piping weighs about 25 pounds and the<br />
antenna another 7 pounds (substantially more than previously), we decided to err on the side of safety, and mounted<br />
the antenna inboard of the railing.&nbsp; If it loosened up due to vibration, or the brackets failed, it should now come<br />
down onto the catwalk rather than drop several decks. We were able to maintain the antenna height and fore-aft<br />
dimensions, but bringing it inboard will alter the port-stbd lever arm up 25 cm (we measured and I will calculate and<br />
compare to previous, but have not done yet).<br />
<br />
Finally, due to all the manipulation, the connector on the coax came apart, so the ComET graciously came up and<br />
reterminated it for us.<br />
<br />
What we would like to see (if this holds up well over the next month) is something similar made out of stainless.&nbsp; We<br />
would like to use a similar schedule and pipe diameter.&nbsp; We would like to cap off the top of the pipe with a flat<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>disk-shaped plate symmetrically mounted and welded.&nbsp; In the center of the plate would be the 5/8&quot; UNC male threads to<br />
screw on the antenna.&nbsp; Toward the outer edges of the disk shaped plate would be the bolt pattern matching the bottom<br />
of the antenna.&nbsp; So, the antenna would first be screwed down onto the plate, and then 10-32 bolts would be used to<br />
bolt the plate to the antenna from the underside.&nbsp; There would probably need to be some streamlining of the area<br />
where the plate is welded to the pipe to make it nice and symmetric and without 90 degree corners.<br />
<br />
I've attached a very rough sketch (sort of perspective and then side view) just to give some visual idea.&nbsp; Because<br />
the Captain is waiting for this I only spent 60 seconds on it.&nbsp; If you would like me to make a more to scale sketch<br />
or draw it up to scale I would be happy to do so.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Allison<br />
