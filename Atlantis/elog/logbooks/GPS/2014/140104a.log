<p>Hi Allison,<br />
<br />
The thread on the base of the AD491 antenna is 5/8&quot; UNC.<br />
<br />
The original antenna used 5/8&quot; BSW, but BSW bolts have all but disappeared so the manufacturer of the AD491 uses 5/8&quot; UNC.<br />
<br />
In terms of the diameter of the pole, standard scaffolding size would be  appropriate (around 2 inches would be more than sufficient).<br />
<br />
Thanks and Best Regards,<br />

<p>Thank you for the specs sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also interested in the female&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
threading that is at the center of the antenna for use in mounting on&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
a pole (we do also have the mount that was designed for the antenna&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
but will likely need to adapt this as we are trying to get the antenna&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
higher in the air.<br />
<br />
I got this as part of an email from someone fashioning a temporary&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
mount for us:<br />
<br />
&quot;not sure why the threads didn't work, as it was made according to C&amp;C's<br />
&quot;BSW&quot; specs&quot;<br />
<br />
Could you give me the specs on the threading?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they:<br />
<br />
Whitworth thread sizes[4]<br />
Whitworth size (in)&nbsp;&nbsp;= 1<br />
Core diameter (in) = 0.8399<br />
Threads per inch = 8<br />
Pitch (in) = 0.125<br />
Tapping drill size = 22 mm (0.8661 in)<br />
<br />
or something&nbsp;&nbsp;different?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also could you give me any recommendations you might be aware of for&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
diameter to height ratios for a mounting pipe?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a minimum&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
suggested diameter?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum?<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help,<br />
