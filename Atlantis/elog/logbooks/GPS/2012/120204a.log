Subject: Firmware update for NaviGator to 6.1.5

========================================
<p>Updated firmware in the NaviGator to 6.1.5.&nbsp; Firmware was over two years old, factory recommended update.&nbsp; Also trying to determine if newer firmware will allow more different settings on the serial ports.&nbsp; Right now, all ports have to run at the same interval.&nbsp; (i.e., once/second. </p>
<ol>
    <li>This is a fairly simple process</li>
    <li>Write all the settings down.</li>
    <li>Power down the NaviGator</li>
    <li>Unplug the serial ports.&nbsp; (not sure if this is needed, but probably better not to have the 2050 sending data over while doing this.)</li>
    <li>put the proper firmware in the top directory on a usb flash drive and plug it into the NaviGator.&nbsp; (Just one file, for this update it was ver6.1.5.cng)</li>
    <li>Restart the Navigator, wait for the menu, select &quot;new firmware&quot; when it comes up.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions.</li>
    <li>Wait.</li>
    <li>Repower the unit, check the settings.&nbsp; (should still be the same, but maybe not.)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you plan on updating the 2050, you must do this first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other ways of doing this, with other instructions.&nbsp; This seems to be the easiest way.&nbsp; The information on how to do this came from the factory.&nbsp; </p>

========================================
<p>
<p>Updated firmware in the 2050G to 5.1.15.&nbsp; Firmware was over two  years old, factory recommended update.&nbsp; Also trying to determine if  newer firmware will allow more different settings on the serial ports.&nbsp;  Right now, all ports have to run at the same interval.&nbsp; (i.e.,  once/second.</p>
<ol>
    <li>This is a fairly simple process</li>
    <li>Write all the settings down.&nbsp; (2050 is accessed via the NaviGator.&nbsp; These are the settings listed under port 1 in the NaviGator, where it says 2050.&nbsp; You should already have all this, since you wrote it down when you did the NaviGator.)</li>
    <li>Make sure port 2 on the 2050 is plugged into port 1 on the NaviGator.</li>
    <li>put the proper firmware in the top directory on a usb flash  drive and plug it into the NaviGator. *</li>
    <li>Find the menu in the Navigator that updates the 2050</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions.</li>
    <li>Wait.</li>
    <li>Repower the unit, check the settings.&nbsp; Some might be different.</li>
</ol>
<p>*The firmware for the 2050 must be obained by calling the factory, they will give you an ftp address to pick it up from.&nbsp; It will be a zip file.&nbsp; Unzip it and put all the files in the top level of a usb flash drive.&nbsp; Some of the files are obviously not needed, some are.&nbsp; Not sure exactly which do what, maybe the HEX, cnu and bin?&nbsp; Anyway, put them all it and the 2050 will select the correct ones.</p>
<p>If you plan on updating the 2050, you must update the NaviGator first.</p>
<p>There are other ways of doing this, with other instructions.&nbsp; This  seems to be the easiest way.&nbsp; The information on how to do this came  from the factory.&nbsp;</p>
