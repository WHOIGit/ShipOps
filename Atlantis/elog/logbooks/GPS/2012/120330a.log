========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Updating the</span><span style="font-size: large;"> firmware for the C-Nav System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">YOU MUST DO THE NAVIGATOR BEFORE YOU DO THE 2050 RECEIVER</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">You will need:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">A USB drive.</span></p>
<h1>NAVIGATOR:</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Write all the settings down (or take pictures).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Power down the Navigator</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Unplug the serial ports (not sure this is necessary but seems like good precaution)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Put the proper firmware in the top directory on the USB flash drive and plug it into the Navigator (usually it is just one file).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Restart the Navigator, wait for the menu (this is sort of a &quot;preboot&quot; menu)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Select &quot;new firmware&quot; when it comes up.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Follow the instructions.<br />
</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: large;">Do not interrupt the process once it starts.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">When done, repower the unit and check the settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2050 Receiver:</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;"><span style="font-size: large;">Write down all of the settings (or take pictures).&nbsp; The 2050 is accessed via the Navigator.&nbsp; THese are the settigns listed under Port 1 in the Navigator where it says 2050.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Make sure that port 2 on the 2050 is plugged into port 1 on the Navigator.&nbsp; Unplug everything else.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Find the menu that updates the Navigator II - to do this you actually need to select &quot;more&quot; at the bottom of the screen to display a second screen that contains the update you want (firmware upgrade).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Wait - DO NOT INTERRUPT THE PROCESS.&nbsp; If it seems to be done instantaneously, you've probably done something wrong (so call the CNAV guy now - ComET has the number of a guy in Louisiana that was very helpful - maybe Glenn Herbert 1-337-210-000).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Re-power the unit and check the settings.&nbsp; Some have probably changed - (on the last upgrade - March 2012 - &quot;raw data&quot; or something like that was suddenly enabled and the Cnav feed to the em122 no longer worked properly due to teh extra garbage being sent).</span></p>
