========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The GPS antennae positions were measured in order to confirm the bow mast benchmark location and the new CNAV antenna postion (moved April 2013)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">{some more stuff happened between here}</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">2014-January-01 the CNAV 3050 antenna mount broke.&nbsp; A replacement mount was made and the antenna was remounted.&nbsp; However, due to safety concerns, the antenna was mounted inboard from the catwalk railing (it was previously outboard).&nbsp; The antenna, therefore, moved 21 centimeters in the Stbd direction (see spreadsheet below for exact details).</span></p>
