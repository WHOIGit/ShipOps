========================================
<p>Replaced busted C-Nav 2050 receiver with new 3050 model.&nbsp; Did not change the Navigator display/control system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New system has 1pps available if needed.&nbsp; Recieves both and GPS/GNSS satellites.&nbsp; Some configuration items are not identical to the old system.&nbsp; Aux output is now on channel two.&nbsp; Connection speed to Navigator is now 57,600.&nbsp;&nbsp; System default is to output GN*** (GNGGA, etc.).&nbsp; This is changable in the setup to GP***.&nbsp; GN*** makes our data collection system unhappy.&nbsp; </p>
