========================================
<p>The pole holding the AD941 antenna broke at a joint, about a foot below the antenna.&nbsp; The antenna weights 7 lbs, the pole broke at a pipe joint.&nbsp;&nbsp; In hindsight, given that the pipe was aluminum and the antenna is so heavy, there should not have been a joint in the pole.&nbsp; A new mount needs to be made/found/installed.&nbsp; </p>
