========================================
<p>The connection between the Cnav 3050 and the Cnavigator swapped to a USB connection 23 Feb 2016.</p>
<p>USB &quot;y&quot; cable coming out of Cnav 3050 now goes to a USB port on Cnavigator.</p>
<p>This frees up Com1 DB9 on the 3050, and Com1 DB9 on the Gator, both for additional feeds. Should eventually use Com1 on the 3050 to feed EM122 and Sonardyne at &gt;2Hz, however data seems to get garbled going through splitters, converters somewhere, so has not been configured yet.</p>
<p>*Important to note that when switching the Cnavigator source between Com1 and USB, each of the Cnavigator's outputs must be maually re-enabled each time (should it ever be desired to go back to the Com1 source).</p>
