========================================
<p>A new 500GB internal hard drive was installed in memory as the /backups drive, to replace the 2TB that died back in December 2013. This is the drive that will hold the daily snapshottars. The external backup drive /media/MemIncBak is still active and installed to handle the incremental guru-style backups.</p>
