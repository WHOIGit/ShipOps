========================================
<p>Changed the hard drive in the computer formerly known as patty, and installed windows 7.&nbsp; We also changed the name of the computer to Mikey.</p>
<p>Re-installed the extra fan that I had installed inside to cool down the internal chips.</p>
<p>Also, I set all the fans to run at a percentage of their capabilities, instead of 'auto'. &nbsp; These computers are very temp sensitive, so I decided to pump them&nbsp; full of cool air, move the air around the insides, and evacuate the hot air at a higher rate than before.&nbsp; So far, the machines have worked well. </p>
