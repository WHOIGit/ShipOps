========================================
<p>Have decided to use WXTS_TP and WXTP_TP as corrected barometric pressure and WXTS_Pa and WXTSP_Pa</p>
<p>Took raw Pa's out of SamosHeader.cfg</p>
<p>Primary air temperature (AT) is now obtained from the IMET sensor (3 decimal places) rather than the port Vaisala (1 decimal place). Samos and NOAA header cfg files corrected to use AT. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Primary humidity sensor (HRH) is now obtained from the IMET sensor (3 decimal places) rather than the stbd Vaisala (1 decimal place). Samos and NOAA headers corrected to use HRH.</p>
