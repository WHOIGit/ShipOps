Subject: LINUS complaining - issues - LOOSE/MAYBE BAD SATA cable

========================================
<p>FIX - <strong>SATA cable not connecting tightly in Linus</strong> (did not test further, cable or SATA conenction on the motherboard could be bad too).&nbsp; See picture below.&nbsp; Started by making sure backups were up-to-date - guru had filled :(&nbsp; And updated linus2 mail accounts after copying and replacing oldlinus /etc/passwd; /etc/shadow; /etc/group; /etc/gshadow with up-to-date newer linus&#39; files (trying to insure correct uuids).&nbsp; After Linus came up and was happy and functional, I did not further test the SATA connection on the motherboard that is suspicious (right now plugged into empty drive slot) nor did I check the cable itself.&nbsp; Laura and I discussed, and with all on the plate right now, decided to leave well enough alone until there is a little more down time for testing.</p>

<p>PROBLEM:</p>

<p>&quot;Linus looks &nbsp;to be having issues. The load average is still up around 3 and dmesg is showing all sorts issues. It<br />
complains about /dev/sdc which is your root drive, which is a bit scary.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel like we had a similar problem on linus (or maybe it was ftp), but we are getting a lot kernel errors:</p>

<p>I feel like this happened before.. and the sata cable was reseated and maybe plugged into another SATA port, and all the errors went away.</p>

<p>Here is an article that seems https://serverfault.com/questions/952148/failed-command-write-fpdma-queued-cause-of-server-running-slow&nbsp; &quot;</p>
