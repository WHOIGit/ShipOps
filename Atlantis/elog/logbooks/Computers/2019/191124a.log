========================================
<pre>
In the case that either linus or ftp are bricked, then the &quot;cliff notes&quot; from Laura for bringing the old LINUS online from the backup 
dplug would be:

1. Update the oldlinus /etc/passwd/ /etc/shadow /etc/group /etc/gshadow
This would get all the users.

2. Copy over /var/spool/mail  as root

3. Copy over /home/users  as user

4. Copy over /usr/local/cmail/outwork
this has the index of the tar file names, copying this over and maybe 
increasing each number by 1 would keep us from writing over files.

I think that would keep mail working. The hostname and IP address of 
oldlinus would need to be changed to linus.

There are a lot of mail files for users that do not exist on linus, not 
sure how that happened.

If linus were to go belly up, it would be best to let me know ASAP and we 
can work together to get oldlinus working. The thing to stay on top of is 
the backups on the dplug.



<strong>If FTP were to go belly up:</strong>

On FTP2  (let me know ASAP)
copy /etc/network/interfaces.ftp /etc/network/interfaces
reboot   # this would get rid of all the odd routing I have setup for the
          # DNS plots

Would need to leave most of the webstuff and scrips as is there were so 
many differences between the OS tha most of the scripts had to be 
rewritten.

Would need to start up iptables.shoremode and move all the ethernet cables 
over.</pre>
