========================================
<p>
<p>New ntp loaded on Athena as per Laura email 19-May-2011 (and more)</p>
<p>VERSION  DOWNLOADED FROM:<br />
http://www.meinberg.de/english/sw/ntp.htm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;  ntp-4.2.4.8@lennon-o-lpv-win32-setup.exe<br />
<br />
***I could not figure  out how to stop TARDIS properly, so I changed the extension on the  executable so that Athena would not find it during start-up.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To  check the status of ntp run:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Program  files/NTP/bin/ntpstatus.bat</p>
