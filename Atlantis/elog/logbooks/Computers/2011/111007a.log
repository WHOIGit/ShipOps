<p>EMAIL TRAIL ABOUT COM PORTS - DISABLING ONE ON MOTHERBOARD SO OTHERS ARE ALL ASSIGNED CORRECTLY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I fixed the .minirc. files so they match up.&nbsp; So, it is still<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minicom hiseasnet<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; to get to the Cisco 2900 (that is presently in charge).&nbsp; However, at2 is plugged into what I assume to be<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; /dev/ttyS0 and I can't talk to it.&nbsp; It works in a different device (meaning it is not the router).&nbsp; I tried<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; plugging a different router into /dev/ttyS0 and got nothing.&nbsp; I also tried putting in a gps string and using<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; minicom and then using the &quot;screen&quot; command and got nothing.&nbsp; In other words, I think that Comm Port is not<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; working (I have identified the other comm port device names- /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyS2, /dev/ttyS3).&nbsp; Is there<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; something else it could be calling itself?&nbsp; Or, do we need to change the card when we get a chance?<br />
<br />
&gt; &gt; I think you need to disable the motherboard comport to get all for serial ports on the card to work. I will<br />
&gt; &gt; have to look at my notes to be sure. I would not worry about it for now since that would involve turning ftp<br />
&gt; &gt; off.<br />
I could not find my notes, but I know we had to disable the comport on the motherboard to get all 4 serial ports<br />
on the two cards to be seen.<br />
<br />
I had a look at the bios and to disable the comport:<br />
<br />
At boot (F11) BIOS-&gt; Intergrated Peripherals-&gt; I/O Devices-&gt; Comport 1 -&gt; Disable<br />
<br />
They will probably all come back w/ different numbers.<br />
