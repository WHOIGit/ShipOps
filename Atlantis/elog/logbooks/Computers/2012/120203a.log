========================================
<p>&nbsp;took mnemosyn out of SSSGOUT since that was restricting it's surfability, and now it is a regular science browser..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>changed the names of the iptables executables, so they make a bit more sense... also wrote a README</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<div>root@ftp bin]# more README.iptables&nbsp;</div>
<div>A Generic Readme for whoi iptables &nbsp; lstolp 20111229</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The iptables running on ftp work as a firewall and also route</div>
<div>traffic to shore and amongst the 4 networks. They are controlled</div>
<div>by the iptable scripts found in: /home/sssg/bin. The scripts are&nbsp;</div>
<div>to be run at the command line, they do all the stopping, flushing etc</div>
<div>of iptables. They can be run one after another. The scripts</div>
<div>include:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>iptables.nosquid &nbsp;# normal iptables without putting any web traffic</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through squid. Squid can still be running.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can be used on a HSD link &nbsp;ie shore.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>iptables.withsquid &nbsp;# Normal at sea iptables, all web traffic</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is put through squid. Should be used when&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at sea.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>iptables.stop &nbsp; &nbsp; # stops all iptables, there will be no routing</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>iptables.restricted_browsing &nbsp;# restricts the number of computers</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that can access the internet.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be used with FBB.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
