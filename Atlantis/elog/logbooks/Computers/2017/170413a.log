========================================
<p>I added another GB of ram to Riley.&nbsp; It had only one GB of ram installed.&nbsp; The ram is maxed out at 2GB because it only has 4 slots and we only have 512MB ram sticks.&nbsp; Hopefully we can change the motherboard at some time since it is one of the old P4 ones.&nbsp; If not, it will still work like it is.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">I added 192.168.13.24 - 27 to the iptables to be able to update the ESET anti-virus definitions.&nbsp; This will be changed when Hilary sets up the NS5 computer to update ESET on the Macs.</span></p>
