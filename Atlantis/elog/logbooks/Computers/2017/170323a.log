========================================
<p>A new shipshare computer was installed 22 March 17. This computer hosts shipshare and no other files. PWs are in the PW file.</p>
<p>It is now the proud owner of the &quot;office&quot; 192.168.12.3 ip address and should play nicely through cyberoam and iptables to other networks. It is NOT connected to the internet.</p>
<p>The outboard office computer is now assigned the ip address 192.168.12.17 and does have internet access in iptables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added an SSSG acct as an administrator just in case the regular administrator acct passwd gets changed and we need to work on the computer. ...ds</p>
