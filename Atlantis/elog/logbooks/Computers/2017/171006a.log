========================================
<p>I increased the attachment size in squirrel mail to 5MB on new linus machine installed Summer 2017. Used same procedure as below for old linus. Only had to change upload_max_filesize to 5M and restart apache service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Used info. found in link Catie found:</p>

<h3>Uploading the attachment to the server</h3>

<p><strong>Limitations in PHP</strong></p>

<p>PHP sets limits on the maximum files size when uploading files to the server. To change this limit, you need to edit the <tt>php.ini</tt> configuration file. The values you will need to increase or decrease are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit" rel="nofollow">[memory_limit]</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size" rel="nofollow">[post_max_size]</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize" rel="nofollow">[upload_max_filesize]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The values can be set in bytes (1,048,576 per MB) or they can be set by MB by appending the value with an &quot;M&quot;, i.e. 8M.</p>

<p>To upload large files, <tt>post_max_size</tt> must be larger than <tt>upload_max_filesize</tt>. If memory limit is enabled by configure script, <tt>memory_limit</tt> also affects file uploading. Generally speaking, <tt>memory_limit</tt> should be larger than <tt>post_max_size</tt>. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.php#ini.post-max-size" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>(SIDE NOTE:&nbsp; I did not find a <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody" rel="nofollow">[LimitRequestBody]</a> in any apache config files that needed changing)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only value I changed was upload_max_filesize (changed to 8M)</p>

<p>once complete I restarted dovecot and apache2 (not sure I needed to restart both, but I did).&nbsp; I tested the new limit, and it appears to work.</p>
