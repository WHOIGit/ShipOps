========================================
<p>General Problem:&nbsp; Linus is giving errors again.&nbsp; The errors are related to the hard drive in position HD4 on the motherboard.&nbsp; I purchased a new SATA cable and replaced the cable we believe is causing the issue.</p>

Hi Laura -</p>

<p>In follow up to our phone conversation about this issue -</p>

<p>Originally, last fall, the cables had been plugged in sequentially to the motherboard. &nbsp;I &quot;fixed&quot; the problem by<br />
taking the cable attached to HD2 and swapping its position on the motherboard with that of HD4. &nbsp;So - the second<br />
hard drive was now plugged into the HD4 position on the motherboard. &nbsp;Clear as mud!</p>

<p>So, last week, when I opened Linus, I removed the cable that was plugged in between the second hard drive and the<br />
HD4 position on the motherboard, and replaced it with a new cable.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this will take care of the issue, but I will keep an eye on Linus!</p>

<p>&gt; Hi Allison.. In you email you said:<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; &quot;Anyway, my back-ups completed, so I opened Linus. &nbsp;I changed the cable on HD2 - I think that was the<br />
&gt; troublesome guy last time. &nbsp;I checked all the other cables to make sure they were not loose.&quot;<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; HD2 would be ata2, the latest error message was from ata4 which would be HD4.<br />

&gt; Could be that you swapped the correct cable, but mistyped... I don&#39;t see any errors, but the issue w/ this is that<br />
&gt; when the errors start the load average goes up and up and up till the computer becomes useless..<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; If you are good w/ what you swapped... Did you put notes in ELOG?<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />

&gt; &gt; Oh - I emailed twice and left a couple phone messages. &nbsp;By teh time I got your email I had changed the cable. &nbsp;I<br />
&gt; &gt; changed the one you are talking about. I sent you the dmesg -T from that boot process. &nbsp;There were some errors,<br />
&gt; &gt; which I wrote you about. &nbsp;I asked you what to do next. &nbsp;I only got the email below about what to do first -<br />
&gt; &gt; which I had already done.<br />
&gt; &gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; &gt; Do you want me to change another cable?<br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Allison,<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is from the email trail: linus errors:<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other issue is a sata issues. It looks like the &#39;issue&#39; followed the<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cable. When Allison was out she powered down linus and swapped sata<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cables, the error:<br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The cable had been on ata2, and it was swapped w/ ata4.. the error followed to ata4, so the cable to change<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out would be ata4.<br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may not see the error messages right away.<br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay - not really finding anything helpful with regard to the errors - but I did look at an older dmesg<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from May - and it looks like those errors were there then too. &nbsp;Not that that makes it okay!<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I am going to head over to the ship in a bit and do some &quot;stuff&quot; so I will check in with you later<br />
