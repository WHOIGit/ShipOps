========================================
<p>OS X users have been having issues accessing files on the shared network drives, such as sci0_on_memory and data_on_memory. Files keep radomly disappearing even though they can be viewed on a windows computer.</p>

<p>Apparently it&#39;s an OS X bug with Samba. Here&#39;s how to fix it:</p>

<p>As admin, create a file named&nbsp;<code>nsmb.conf</code>.</p>

<pre>
<code>sudo vi /etc/nsmb.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Put the following inside:</p>

<pre>
<code>[default]
file_ids_off=yes
</code></pre>

<p>Save. Reboot. Done.</p>
