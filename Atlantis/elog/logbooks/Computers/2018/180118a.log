========================================
<p>3PS computer had the wrong date and time - prompting me to try to get teh timeserver working.&nbsp; It was (must just have died at some point).</p>

<p>#### start of email<br />
I installed ntp on the mainlab 3ps computer..</p>

<p>Installed: ntp-4.2.4p8@lennon-o-lpv-win32-setup.exe</p>

<p>using ftp as server (192.168.11.1)..</p>

<p>click:</p>

<p>start-&gt;All programs -&gt; Meinberg-&gt; Network Time Protocol-&gt; Quick NTP status</p>

<p>to check the status.</p>

<p>#### end</p>

<p>Maybe it is a new computer, but from googling XP, if using XP&#39;s windoze time, make sure w32tm is running and then try this on the command line. I<br />
honestly don&#39;t think I had much luck w/ getting ntp to work w/ out using the meinberg sortware</p>

<p>### from web</p>

<p>When Command Prompt starts, enter the following commands:<br />
w32tm /debug /disable<br />
w32tm /unregister<br />
w32tm /register<br />
net start w32time<br />
If everything was successful, you should see &ldquo;The windows Time Service is starting. The windows time service was started successfully.&rdquo; message.<br />
Close Command Prompt and try to synchronize your clock.<br />
