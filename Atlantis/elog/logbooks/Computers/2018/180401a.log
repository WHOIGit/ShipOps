========================================
<p>For the second time this week, the Knudsen computer locked up for no apparent reason (it is not in use, just sitting idle). It does not shut down, the desktop stays up, but mouse and keyboard cease to work and you are alerted to it by the ship webpage, data, etc. running crazy slow. It won&#39;t unmount from linus, you have to do a umount -l. Needs fixing as time permits.</p>
