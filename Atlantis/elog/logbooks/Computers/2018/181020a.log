========================================
<p>We currently have a GPS feed broadcasting on UDP port 55000. Chris Roman, one of the PI&#39;s, was wondering if we could output that exact feed on another UDP port. He has two programs running on the same computer that need to access that feed, but you can&#39;t open the same UDP port from two locations at a time. So on the 161.191 Moxa, I made the same port that&#39;s already outputting UDP on 55000 also output on 55002 as well. I also added a relay script on the FTP server to broadcast this to the science network so Chris can get it. I&#39;ll remember to set everything back the way it was when the cruise is over.</p>
