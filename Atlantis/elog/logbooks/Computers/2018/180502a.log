========================================
<p>Installed computer newknudsen. Windows 7. Running latest echocontrol software. IP is 199.92.161.138.</p>

<p>Old knudsen still works, however has been locking up occasionally, so with geology/seismic trips coming up need to transition to 3260 USB from the 320 SCSI.</p>
