========================================
<div>A bitDefender server was installed on the science network:</div>

<ul>
	<li>192.168.11.27 &nbsp;bitdefender.science. atlantis.whoi.edu</li>
	<li>updated bind</li>
	<li>the computer is set up as a server which is not the normal download from the IS website, it is using fullKit_unix64.tar</li>
	<li>Mark Jones (IS security) changed the default profile (for all instances of WHOI bitDefender) to look for a relay (the ship&#39;s server) first and if not reachable look for the mothership (WHOI&#39;s server patronis.whoi.edu</li>
	<li>there should be no configuration on either the clients or the server.</li>
</ul>
