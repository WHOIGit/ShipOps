========================================
<p>The rsync to shore for the incoming/outgoing boxes is done via the &quot;atlantis&quot; user crontab.&nbsp; The commands used are in /home/atlantis/bin (also saee crontab -l).</p>

<p>Memory now has two eth ports eth0 = science net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eth1 = port fbb</p>

<p>The large files are usually (or can be) routed through the port fbb.</p>

<p>To see what route do:</p>

<p>&gt;route -n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>example output:</p>

<p>A route can be added or removed.&nbsp; Examples:</p>

<p>sudo route del -host 128.128.250.51 gw 192.168.0.1 dev eth1<br />
or<br />
sudo route add -host 128.128.250.51 gw 192.168.11.1 dev eth0<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the port fbb route is removed or disabled, the route flops over to hiseasnet without needing to add the route for hiseasnet (at least as of 2018-Jan-17).&nbsp; I am not sure what happens with the port fbb route from time to time, but I was able to get to the port fbb with netbook, but still not route through it at times.</p>
