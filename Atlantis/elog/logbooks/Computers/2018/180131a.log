========================================
<p>Added a script on linus to run in /home/sssg after downloading the cruise letter.&nbsp; Run the script as:</p>

<p>./mk_cruise_meta.pl <em>name_of_cruise_letter</em></p>

<p>script will do its best to make the file cruise_metadata to be edited and moved to /home/data.&nbsp; R2R and Laura decided on a new format, and this script will hopefully help create that format without a bunch of additional typing.&nbsp; It is not perfect, however, as the structure of the cruise letter is not always identical.&nbsp; So, the cruise_metadata file created needs to be checked and edited.</p>
