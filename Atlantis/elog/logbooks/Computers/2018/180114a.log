========================================
<p>This Spybot Anti-Beacon seems to turn off some of the chattyness of windows10. I think they have had some good luck on the Healy with with. I have never<br />
used it. It might be worth trying.</p>

<p>thanks, laura</p>

<p>We have been testing Spybot Anti-Beacon with good results:</p>

<p>https://www.safer-networking.org/spybot-anti-beacon/</p>

<p>It blocks a lot of the telemetry etc. down to settings that you would have to dig<br />
into the registry to change. We have seen no ill effects, and based on traffic<br />
through our firewall, appears to work pretty well. It works on Win10, 8, and 7.<br />
