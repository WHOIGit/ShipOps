<p><span style="font-size: large;">backingup mailhost, ftp, datalog</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">swapped guru plug out for a dreamplug with 2T westerdigital USB drive. Directions to for dreamplug install from scratch attached. These instructions are used for the R2R ELOG dreamplug as well. The dreamplug runs off of the external USB disk, so if it dies just replace the disk. The image is stored on squidly (netbook) in /home/sssg/images/atguru, if any significant changes are made, create a new image.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">NOTES - from going over the atguru with Laura May 2013:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scripts for doing backups to atguru are in /root/bin</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO MAKE A NEW CARD:&nbsp; on squidly - the file called command contains the command line needed - plug a card into the netbook, make sure the card is not mounted, copy and paste the information from command file onto the command line and run.&nbsp; These files are on squidly linus partition in /home/sssg/images - device may differ from sdb - backup copies on sssg_on_memory<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Make a new image file:&nbsp; do the &quot;dd&quot; command in the command line file backward (exchanging target and host</span> <span style="font-size: large;">- teh input would be the /dev/sdb or whatever the device is &amp; the output would be the new name)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more pieces involved in hooking up to the dreamplug (jtag box, jtag-UART cable) - these are in the cabinet in the computer lab CL19</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ATGURU is ipaddress 199.92.161.17</span></p>
