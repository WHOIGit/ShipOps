========================================
<p>replaced currents1 with new 1u computer and USB serial thingy.. running lates UHDAS and Xubuntu 12.04</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># email from Jules.. she setup both to use USB serial device</p>
<p>OK, so here's the status:<br />
Currents2 logged happily overnight using the usb serial logging device.&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier 'sensor_cfg.py' file<br />
(configured for the Digi) is named sensor_cfg.py.digi <br />
<br />
Currents1 is all set up. I can't figure out how to get better screen resolution than 1280x1024. Could be<br />
worse.&nbsp; Allison said not to worry. <br />
<br />
So, all is well. Happy cruising. <br />

<p>&nbsp;# ACCESS CONTROLS</p>
<div># -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>##</div>
<div>## In general we don't do much access control via acls, since access is&nbsp;</div>
<div>## already controlled via the firewall.</div>
<div>## But if we wanted to block cache access to certain domains, we could do that</div>
<div>## here. &nbsp;Though it probably makes more sense to do it in the firewall</div>
<div>## since that is where we already control access.</div>
<div>##</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>## define a rule to match connections to blocked sites, where blocked sites</div>
<div>## is defined in the /usr/local/squid/etc/blocked_sites file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>acl blocked_sites url_regex -i &quot;/usr/local/squid/etc/blocked_sites&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>## Added per Amy &nbsp; &nbsp; lstolp 20130520</div>
<div>acl updates url_regex update</div>
<div>acl dropbox url_regex dropbox</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>## deny access to blocked sites</div>
<div>http_access deny blocked_sites</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div># The following limits the number of conncurrent connections that can be opened</div>
<div># by a single computer. &nbsp;connlimit listed elsewhere</div>
<div># rlaird:2010-01-15: deny any requests in excess of &quot;connlimit&quot; ACL.</div>
<div>http_access deny &nbsp;connlimit</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>## Added per Amy &nbsp; lstolp 20130520</div>
<div>http_access deny updates</div>
<div>http_access deny dropbox</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>## allow general http access for all requests that have been forward to squid</div>
<div>## Note: if the firewall did not already control access to squid we would put</div>
<div>## more rules here for access control.</div>
<div>http_access allow all</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>## deny http access to any requests which we haven't handled above</div>
<div>http_access deny all</div>
