========================================
<p>&nbsp;little googling into ntop segmentation fault because it would only run a few <br />
&gt; minutes at a time.&nbsp; Besides most of the 'update your version of ntop, this <br />
&gt; bug is fixed' one of the sites said delete these two files in /var/lib/ntop/:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; addressQueue.db<br />
&gt; dnsCache.db<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>removed above from /var/lib/ntop to see if it will run for awhile.. </p>
