========================================
<p>We have probably have a workaround at this point but I wanted to follow up on an issue with Windows 10 and windows updates while on<br />
cruises.&nbsp; At this point without manual intervention, you cannot turn off windows updates on Windows 10.&nbsp; However, as temporary work<br />
around, while on a cruise, you can advise users to do the following to turn of the windows update service which will halt the<br />
downloads.&nbsp; They will need to remember to turn back on the Windows update service when they depart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can do this using the Windows Update service. Via Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools, you can access Services. In the Services<br />
window, scroll down to Windows Update and turn off the process. To turn it off, right-click on the process, click on Properties and<br />
select Disabled. That will take care of Windows Updates not being installed on your machine.<br />

<br />
After you turn back on the Windows Update service selecting &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo;, when you open Windows Update in PC Settings, you will see a<br />
message that updates were not installed because computer or service was stopped. You will have to click on Retry so that all the<br />
available updates are downloaded and installed. This may take two or three &ldquo;Check for Updates&rdquo;. You will have to keep on clicking<br />
&ldquo;Check for updates&rdquo; until it says your computer is up to date.<br />
