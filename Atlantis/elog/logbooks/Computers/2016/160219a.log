========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">TRIED THIS METHOD 18-APRIL-2016 - IT DID NOT WORK</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; The new computers with only USB keyboard and mouse connections do not like to communicate with the KVM switch after rebooting said switch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; After rebooting the KVM switch, unplug the aft console keyboard from the KVM switch for a few seconds.&nbsp; When you plug it back in, you should have keyboard and mouse control on all the computers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; Prior to unplugging the keyboard, you will notice that the Scroll Lock light is stuck on.&nbsp; Once you do the fix, it will go out until you press the Scroll Lock key.&nbsp; That tells you that the keyboard and KVM switch are friends again. </span></p>
