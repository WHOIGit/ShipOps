I have reset the password to the Apple ID.&nbsp; It now requires an email address as the ID.&nbsp; It<br />
has to be an email address that is not currently associated with an Apple ID.&nbsp; Maybe Dave<br />
could use his sssg@atlantis.whoi.edu address.&nbsp; It is hard because most people already use<br />
their email as their personal Apple ID.&nbsp; That was what worked with the username woods for so<br />
long&hellip;&nbsp; but they no longer allow that.&nbsp; So, the new password is 1nsane+Great.&nbsp; You can log in<br />
using woods and that password, then it is going to require the new email address for the ID.<br />

Hi All,<br />
<br />
I ran into BL today and she gave me the following info for the apple online id and password<br />
to upgrade our software:<br />
<br />
id: woods<br />
pwd: dvorak123<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet but it should help us upgrade the software for the ship&rsquo;s macs and<br />
the iMac I have here (from problems associated with upgrading to El Capitan).&nbsp; If you try<br />
this please let me know if it works<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

&gt; Hi Scott,<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;&nbsp; I can't get it to work.&nbsp; It looked like Dvorak123 was going to work, but the account is<br />
locked and wants the birth date associated with the account.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; aloha,<br />
&gt; ds<br />
<br />
Short-lived excitement. Still, it&rsquo;s progress. <br />
<br />
Just in case BL is still getting email I added her former whoi email to the cc: list. Maybe<br />
she&rsquo;ll see it?<br />

<br />
<br />
Hi BL! I hope you&rsquo;re well.<br />
<br />
Dave Sims tried the App Store credentials you passed on via Bruce earlier. That got past the<br />
first level but<br />
App Store claimed it was a closed account, asked for a (your?) birthdate.<br />
<br />
Is it possible for you to re-open these App Store credentials? They pertain to the two<br />
MacPros you set up<br />
for Alvin in late 2012 per request of Join Howland. There&rsquo;s sw to be updated, primarily but<br />
not limited to<br />
Final Cut.<br />
<br />
TIA<br />
