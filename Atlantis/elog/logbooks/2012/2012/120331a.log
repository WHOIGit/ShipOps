========================================
<p>MArch 30, 2012 - Starboard Vaisala went out for about 30 minutes from 7:50 GMT to 8:20 GMT</p>
<p>I noticed after the fact (not during my shift, so I'm not sure if anything was done to restart it - I do know the IMET tower was not power cycled because the rain accumulation was still the same when it came back)</p>
