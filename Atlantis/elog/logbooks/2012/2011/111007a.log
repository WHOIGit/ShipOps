========================================
<p>Thank you very much for an enjoyable and very much worthwhile visit to R/V<br />
Atlantis today.<br />
<br />
As promised, I have copied below a message from Carl Mattson, senior SIO<br />
research technician, regarding weights and tensions (and former problems)<br />
experienced when working with the SIO 36-place rosette system. It was<br />
experiences with shorts such as he describes which spurred our present use<br />
of slow haul-in speeds when &gt;5000 meters of wire is out. On the recent<br />
CLIVAR cruises with this package on Revelle, Melville, and Palmer, we have<br />
not had a reoccurrence of this problem or other cable problems<br />
attributable to the large rosette system.<br />
<br />
In fact, even on a rough two-month Southern Ocean cruise on the Palmer<br />
earlier this year, where 8 days were lost to weather, 140 stations were<br />
occupied without incident over a two-month period, using this package and<br />
a standard UNOLS 0.322 CTD cable. The only reterminations were done as<br />
part of routine maintenance. This has been typical of cruises with this<br />
package in the past 3-4 years.<br />
<br />
We hope to continue to work with you to ensure that you are supportive of<br />
our working with this rosette on R/V Atlantis in the same manner that we<br />
have been on the other Global-class ships.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your weekend in San Diego.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

Subject: Re: rosette weight and wire loads<br />
<br />
Jim<br />
<br />
&gt;From my observations over the years I would say that the actual max<br />
working load is about 4400lbs. This may sound like an arbitrary value but<br />
it is based on observations.<br />
<br />
Most manufacturers of EM-cable go by the 4 to 1 rule to determine max<br />
working load. If this was applied to the .322 then the max working load<br />
would be about 2900lbs. However, the .322 data sheet from Rochester Corp.<br />
says that the max working load is less than or equal to 5000lbs. There is<br />
a continuing argument amongst technicians about which value is closer to<br />
the actual value.<br />
<br />
On some cruises on the Knorr the .322 cable has, at times, developed a<br />
short on one or more conductors. When using the 36pl rosette this<br />
sometimes happened just after a series of deep casts of 6000-6500M meters.<br />
The short is usually located about 6-7KM up from the termination end. This<br />
has happened on different cables on different cruises. It doesn't happen<br />
often but it has happened.<br />
<br />
The weight of the wire (value taken from the data sheet)in seawater<br />
(without rosette) is about 463 lbs/KM so at 6KM just the weight of the<br />
cable is 2776lbs. The rosette in water is about 1200lbs. The total at 6KM<br />
is about 4000lbs. A typical value read on the tension meter (on Melville)<br />
is around 4200-4500lbs (winch stopped). When the winch is coming up<br />
(60MPM) then add about 500lbs to that. Also, there is always some extra<br />
tension caused by subsurface currents. Usually the short in the conductor<br />
happens during the upcast just after going to 10M above the bottom at<br />
depths &gt;6KM. On some occasions it was reported to be about 6200 or more.<br />
This would give us about 2870lbs on the cable weight - 4200lbs total<br />
theoretical weight(winch stopped). When the winch is coming up at these<br />
depths then you can add another 500lbs to the total tension due to the<br />
drag of the rosette.<br />
<br />
We have routinely used this cable with the 36PL rosette with few problems<br />
over many years. I believe that cable problems happen when the rosette is<br />
greater than 6000M and the winch is coming up too fast on the upcast. If<br />
the winch speed is kept low (creeping up to 20-30MPM) and tension kept<br />
below 4400 then it should be ok. As you come up to &lt;5700M then gradually<br />
increase winch speed to 50MPM.<br />
