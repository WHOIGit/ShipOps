========================================
<p>More informantion, based on working with the new parts sent by Elan and purchased from McMaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>1- The original compressor had very little wear on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was not the cause of the water problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I removed the &quot;new&quot; compressor and put the original one back in.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be good for at least a few more years, and this way our spare is still &quot;new&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; (it has a few hundred hours on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>2- The four way valve had a lot of dust in it, and was probably not working correctly, although it was working partially.&nbsp; (this was replace in the original repair.</p>

<p>3- The water seperator was very clogged up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the system was still able to maintain 90psi, this was probably causing some extra work for the air compressor.&nbsp;&nbsp; (this was replace in the original repair.)</p>

<p>4- The two way valve was bit corroded, but seemed to be working fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; (this was replace in the original repair.)</p>

<p>Normal operation-&nbsp; The four way valve alternates position about every minute or so.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when you hear the big pffftt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Air is sent alternately through each of the silver columns.&nbsp;&nbsp; they are identical, and are filled with a molecular sieve material that removes the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the valve operates, the column in use is rapidly decompressed, (rapid is important), this in turn causes the traped water to leave the sieve.&nbsp;&nbsp; A slow flow of air then pushes this damp mixture out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the other, just dried out column, is drying the air being sent on to the cooling unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a water drain for the other water seperator.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the two way valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems to run about once a minute as well, but it&#39;s not tied to the schedule of the 4 way valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just opens for a split second.&nbsp;&nbsp; But drain lines are in the center of the unit, under the compressor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both drains have a muffler on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the muffler gets clogged, the performance of the system will suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, so far they show no signs of clogging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Testing-&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of the parts can be tested by blowing through them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most all the hoses are the push to connect type, if you hold down the ring, you can pull them out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be easy to blow through the first water seperator, (the one with the bowl), and the two way valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the drain lines should also be easy to blow through.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four way valve is not as easy to blow through, as the passages are fairly small.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two way valve should seal when the power is off.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four way valve will be open straight across with no power, and will be crossed when there is power.&nbsp; Each inlet should go only to one other outlet, there should be no &quot;crosstalk&quot; or leaking between the two parts.</p>

<p>When you start up the system, espacially if it&#39;s been off for a long time, keep in eye on the clear tubing and watch for water carryover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO NOT LET WATER GET INTO THE COOLING UNIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you see any water at all, remove the air line from the cooling unit and run the sytem in standby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, the compressor should put out enough dry air to dry things out.</p>
