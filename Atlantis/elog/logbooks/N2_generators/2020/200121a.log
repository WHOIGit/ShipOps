========================================
<p>Short version:&nbsp; Numerous email were exchanged with Elan, all to no avail.&nbsp; Numerous parts were replaces, also to no avail.&nbsp; Turns out that there is <em>another </em>water seperator located inside the refridgeration unit, right where the airline comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was about 1/3 full of water.&nbsp; (perhaps a tablespoon?)&nbsp;&nbsp; Removed the water and continued to run in standby.&nbsp;&nbsp; After about 12+ hours, the humidity alarm stayed off, the refridgeration compressor came on, and the system started making liquid nitrogen.</p>

<p>Long version:&nbsp; The original problem seemed to be that the air compressor generated an excess of water, which was then carried over into the refridgeration compressor. &nbsp; The cause of this is unknown, however, the system had been off for a long time. &nbsp; One might wonder if both of the dessicant driers were saturated. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The help from the factory seemed just be recomending replacing everything that was supplied with the spares kit.&nbsp;&nbsp; There did not seem to be any logic to their recomendations.&nbsp; All told, I replaced the compressor, the four way valve, the two way valve and the water separator.&nbsp;&nbsp; (however, I had to use the original bowl, as the replacement did not have the correct fitting on the bottom.)&nbsp;&nbsp; None of these made any difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes on the system:&nbsp;&nbsp; The air compressor is fairly conventional.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the parts are COTS, with the exception of what appears to be a dessicant drier system, (two shiny aluminum tubes), and a fitting the is on the water seperator bowl.&nbsp;&nbsp; Air come out of the compressor and goes through the water seperator.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a solenoid valve connected to this that periodically drains the water out.&nbsp; (about every few minutes.)&nbsp;&nbsp; From there, the air goes to the four way valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; (this valve sends the air either straight through, or does a &quot;cross&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp; From the four way, the air goes through one of the dessicant dryers.&nbsp; After leaving the dryer, most of the air goes to the refridgeration compressor, while a small portion is bled back through the other dessicant dryer and bleeds off to the atmosphere.&nbsp; The four way valve switches back and forth, alternately flushing each drier to keep it operational. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dryer operation: &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a pretty standard industrial method of producing dry air.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two dessicant columns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dry, but saturated air from a compressor is passed through one of the columns to dry it out.&nbsp; A fraction of this dry air is also used to flush out the other column. &nbsp; After a fixed period of time, (minutes in this case), a four way valve swaps both inlets and both exhaustes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two things happen.&nbsp; One, the column that was in use experiences rapid, near explosive decompression.&nbsp;&nbsp; This causes the moisture that is in the desicant to sort of burst out as a vapor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing that happens is that the &quot;new&quot; column commences to dry the air, and a portion of that same dry air is used to flush out the moisture in the other column.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s important to note that the air used to flush out the moisture is not &quot;drying&quot; the dessicant.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid decompression pulled out the moisture.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dry air is just flushing it out.&nbsp; And so on, every few minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some issue we might watch for, none of which were brought up by Elan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The desicants might be giving off some dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I don&#39;t know exactly how the the columns are constructed, there might be some filters.)&nbsp;&nbsp; There is evidence of dust in the four way valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dust will clog up the four way valve, and it will also clog up the muffler that is on the end of the line that discharges the air when the dessicants decompress.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the rate of decompression is slowed down, the system does not work efficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we need to keep an eye on this.</p>
