Good morning,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matt is no longer with the company, please email out mfg manager, Freddie, copied, and myself when you need anything with the Elan2 J<br />
Please find the user manuals attached for the Office and ATS units.</p>

<p>What is your company name? so I can look you up and see which model you have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maintenance on the Elan2 is simple.</p>

<p>The Air Filters need to be replaced MONTHLY, your email stated yearly, that is way too long to wait to replace it.</p>

<p>We sell extra Air Filters for $60 for a pack of 12, that will last you 1 year.</p>

<p>The Air Compressor usually needs servicing every 2-3 years, we have a few options for this..</p>

<p>We sell Air Compressor Refurnishing Kits for $1,015 and a tech at your location can easily refurbish the compressor.</p>

<p>The refurbishing kit comes with all parts that you will need to replace in the compressor and should be fairly simple for a technician at your company to replace, but<br />
you can always call us and we can walk you through the process if need be J</p>

<p>If you do not want to get a refurbishing kit we also have a refurbishing program where you purchase a refurbished air compressor for $1,500 (plus shipping) and once<br />
you get that set up with your unit you send us back the failed compressor.</p>

<p>Last option would be to ship the compressor back to MMR for servicing, this takes the longest amount of time and can be more expensive than purchasing a refurbished<br />
compressor &nbsp;or refurbishing kit depending on what is wrong with it.</p>

<p>You can also always just purchase a brand new compressor, we actually just came out with the new Whisper Compressor mid 2018, brochure attached if you are interested.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regards,<br />
<br />
Maria</p>
