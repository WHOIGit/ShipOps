========================================
<p>Emily had told me about the compressor&#39;s metallic &quot;rattling&quot; noise after it had suddenly lost power due to shipwide blackouts.&nbsp; I suggested that we do whatever we can to avoid future damage by plugging it into UPS power as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Prior to departing Manzanillo, I strung an extension cord from the BioAnalytical Lab to the Computer Lab where there was a UPS outlet in the ceiling right above the winch control station.&nbsp; (See attached pictures)</p>

<p>The manual for the ELAN2 suggests shutting down the unit as <strong>infrequently</strong> as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully, in the future, perhaps during&nbsp;midlife, the engineers can install a more long-term solution like a new UPS outlet in that corner of the BioAnalytical Lab so we don&#39;t have to rely on this long extension cord that could potentially be unplugged by accident.</p>

========================================
<p>Prior to leaving Manzanillo for AT42-21, a consistent error started appearing on the LED screen on the Liquefier unit.&nbsp; The error was:&nbsp;<strong>Error 002, High Humidity</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I called the manufacturer&#39;s support line (MMR) and was told to make sure that the compressor and liquifier were both in low humidity conditions.&nbsp; At the time, the compressor was outside of the walk-ins in an area that was very warm and humid.&nbsp; Following the manufacturer&#39;s advice, I moved the compressor into the Bio Lab which had a much lower humidity and temperature.&nbsp; After Emily used dry air to blow out the air tubes between the compressor and liquefier, I was told by MMR to keep the units running in stand by mode for 24 hours.&nbsp; This was so that the compressor could &quot;work out&quot; all of the condensation inside of it.&nbsp; Apparently, it periodically sprays any moisture onto a sponge below the motor and the heat from the motor helps it evaporate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have had it in standby mode for over a week now and it still has the High Humidity Error.&nbsp; We will try to contact MMR again after the holidays are over.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
