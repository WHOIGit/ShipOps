========================================
<p>The internal, hermetically-sealed compressor unit within the transfer station emitted louder, metallic noises toward the end of cruise AT42-12. This followed two abrupt shutdowns within two weeks due to ship-wide power outages. Once in port, the unit was placed in standby and the chassis taken off to inspect the components. Nothing was found loose or vibrating when the unit was running and the front and rear fan units were also secured to check that the noise was not coming from either of those units. When the LN2 generator was placed back online again, videos were taken and sent to MMR to assist with diagnosing the source and cause of the noise. MMR recommended shipping the unit back. For the entirety of this cruise, the unit remained secured and the science party made use of the full 20-liter Dewars we had onboard. The unit is being shipped from Newport, Oregon to the MMR facility in San Jose, California&nbsp;</p>
