========================================
<p>I misunderstood the manual about the meaning of the 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, full lights - these are for the internal tank.</p>

<p>When the display panel says &quot;FULL&quot; - that means the external dewar is full.</p>

<p>Hi Allison,<br />
The small lights 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, FULL indicate the internal liquefier tank. During normal operation (liquefying with the<br />
system unlocked and the transfer tube present) you only ever see the full light come on for 10 seconds as it will then start<br />
transferring into the tank.<br />
If you lock the system or remove the transfer hose from the dewar (auto transfer will be turned off) and the liquefier will<br />
fill all the way up. The full light will come on and the system will cycle on and off every 30 minutes keeping the tank<br />
full.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When the digital panel says FULL this is because the external tank is FULL. The system has tried to transfer into the tank 6<br />
times but the sensor on the transfer tube has triggered. During this mode the system has shut down. You need to press the<br />
transfer button to restart the system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this all makes sense.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Kind Regards,</p>

========================================
<p>I looked in the urn after using the spout - ift looked like less than a liter.&nbsp; So, after transferring and letting the urn get to room temperature, I filled the urn with water to the approximate height the LN2 reached inside.&nbsp; I then used a measuring cup (metric) to measure the volume of water.&nbsp; It is 1 Liter!!!</p>
