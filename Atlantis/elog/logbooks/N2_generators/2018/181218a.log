========================================
<p>At 2315 UTC secured LN2 generator after following recommended shutdown procedure from manual:</p>

<p>2110 placed unit in standby mode (toggle on back of unit)</p>

<p>2115 pressed &quot;transfer&quot; and unit went through&nbsp;defrost cycle in order to transfer remaining liquid nitrogen in the generator</p>

<p>2245 unit made final transfer to Dewar</p>

<p>I removed the dispenser and placed the cap on the Dewar. Each Dewar is still about 5/6&nbsp;full.</p>

<p>2315&nbsp;Generator unit powered off after confirmation&nbsp;that fans and air compressor had stopped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
