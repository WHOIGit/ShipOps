<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi Dave,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks again for the chat. &nbsp;As promised, here&rsquo;s what I learned about the dewar:</p>

<p>The engineers report that membrane failure etc is very rare because the system is designed to have the compressors fail before they blow any dirt into the unit. &nbsp;I was<br />
&nbsp;wondering if installing a filter between the compressor and the unit is of use, or if it&rsquo;s overkill, but I did not ask.</p>

<p>I was also told that we should make an effort to keep the compressor in an environment with little or no dust, and well off the floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They sell a $1,000 service kit to rebuild the compressor and replace all the filters. &nbsp;They said that we should expect between 1-2 years of service without having to d<br />
o this.</p>

<p>As for LN2 spilling, they said it would take some SERIOUS pitching for the LN2 to spill out. &nbsp;They also noted that the British Antarctic Survey vessels use these, and&nbsp;<br />
the manufacturer would provide us with refs if needed.</p>

<p>They also noted that using their big storage dewar to capture LN2 is the most efficient way to go. &nbsp;Also, of course, the efficiency is a function of external temps, et<br />
c &nbsp;Because the Bio lab is often as cold as Walt Disney&rsquo;s cryo-preservations chamber I suspect we will get good performance.</p>

<p>NOTE: One thing I want to point out is that nitrogen gas in an enclosed space is lethal. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t mean the wiffs in the bio lab, which are irrelevant. &nbsp;I mean that the<br />
&nbsp;RV Atlantis should put up some signs warning people not to handle LN@ in an enclosed space like the coldrooms. If I remember correctly, those coldroom dot exchange ai<br />
r with the outside. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s too much N2 buildup people can pass out and die of asphyxia, and their body will never know it because you cannot detect N2 gas. &nbsp;Make&nbsp;<br />
sense? &nbsp;The risk here is really low, but most people are unaware the N2 gas filling a room can kill you. I do think, however, that appropriate and clear signage on the<br />
&nbsp;coldroom doors are appropriate. &nbsp;Does that make sense? &nbsp;This has always been a risk on vessels (whether is dry ice ==&gt; CO2 or LN2 ==&gt; nitrogen gas), and I doubt that&nbsp;<br />
the inclusion of a LN2 generator that drips out 8L a day is going to increase the risk of something bad happening. &nbsp;That said, it&rsquo;s nice to take this moment to get the<br />
&nbsp;signs up telling people not to work in the enclosed coldrooms with an excess of LN2.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That&rsquo;s it Dave. &nbsp;Thanks again for your help.<br />
Pete</p>
