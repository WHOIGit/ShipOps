========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Also on sci0_on_memory are the folders for incoming and outgoing files.&nbsp; If you have files that need to be copied to shore, put them in the outgoing folder.&nbsp; They will be copied to a WHOI server on shore.&nbsp; Your shoreside contact may download the files by&nbsp; &quot;ftp'ing&quot; to this server or putting: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ftp://128.128.250.51&nbsp; in their browser and then navigating to:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pub/ship/atlantis/science/incoming from here they can save the desired file to their own computer.<br />
<br />
If someone on shore wants to send you something.&nbsp; They can &quot;ftp&quot; to the server.&nbsp; There are many third party software products on the internet that can be used to do this if one does not know how to do it from a command window (Fetch is one example).&nbsp; The user name and password are:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user:&nbsp;&nbsp; atsci<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password:&nbsp; atsci!2012<br />
<br />
You may give this information out to your shoreside contacts.<br />
<br />
Do not delete anything from the &quot;incoming&quot; folder on either end (please tell your shoreside people the same).&nbsp; It will only be re-copied again, using up valuable bandwidth.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">************************</span><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">FOR SSSG ONLY - DON'T GIVE SCIENCE THIS INFO:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">SSSG can also logon as username:&nbsp; atlantis &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; pw:&nbsp; ATL!2010</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">puts you in the /home/atlantis directory and you have to navigate to /home/atsci where the incoming and outgoing directories are.&nbsp; This login gives ability to delete items, etc. so it is possible to clean out the boxes when done.&nbsp; Remember to delete the outgoing boxes first (i.e. delete items in outgoing box on atlantis before deleting these same items from the incoming box on the shore side - or else they may begin sync'ing again)&nbsp; </span></p>
