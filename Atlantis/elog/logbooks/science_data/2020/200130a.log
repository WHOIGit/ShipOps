========================================
<p>There should no longer be any READ_ME.txt files added to the cruise data directories.</p>

<p>An Elog should be created for every cruise regardless of if science is using it or not. All SSSG science &quot;events&quot;, things like starting seawater system, cleaning the underway fluorometer, swapping out a bad CTD sensor, bird made a nest on the Vaisala sensor, basically any metadata that affects the final cruise data package should go into Elog so R2R can better track down data inconsistencies a year later.</p>
