<p>&gt; Ship Recruiting</p>
<p>&gt;Ship Recruiting (again)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;Metadata Interface&nbsp;&nbsp; from drop down menu</p>
<p>login&nbsp; (see password file&nbsp; &quot;Samos&quot;)</p>
<p>Brings you to the list of ships where you can select &quot;modify&quot; &nbsp; either vessel metadata or instrument metadata.</p>
<p>If changing up an instrument, Select &quot;In Use&quot; at the top of teh page</p>
<p>Select &quot;+&quot; sign in front of instrument to open that instrument.&nbsp; You need to close out the &quot;Valid Date&quot; on a present instrument </p>
<p>before you can add a different one in its place (it was really picky about matching up the designator and dates and selecting</p>
<p>&quot;modify&quot; and changing the end date and making sure you've submitted it before it would let you add another.</p>
<p>The old instrument in the list was highlighted in &quot;yellow&quot; when I was done.&nbsp; Not sure why - maybe it is so Samos people could see</p>
<p>that information actually changed and was valid a couple months ago ...</p>
