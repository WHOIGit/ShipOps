========================================
<p>Transcend drives do not auto-mount on the new FTP machine installed August 2017.</p>

<p>Everytime I have done this so far, a Transcend drive shows up as sdd1. So to mount:</p>

<p>sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdd1 /media/Transcend/</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t positive it is sdd1, then compare what is in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ when the drive is plugged in and when it is not.</p>
