========================================
<p>Built new 3.5 kHz and 12 kHz cable for the new 3260 Knudsen.&nbsp; For whatever reasons, this turned out to be a big pain in the tush. Newark sent the wrong cable clamp, (seem like something is wrong with the newark catalog), so there are no proper clamps on the cables.&nbsp; Because the cables feed through a stuffing tube, the cable have be partly built in place.&nbsp; Also, the retainer for pin &quot;C&quot; in the 3.5k cable failed.&nbsp; (The Canon connector, not the XLR)&nbsp; It's assembled in a way that should work, but don't mess with it.&nbsp; (it needs to be bent the way it presently is.)&nbsp; In any case, both cable need to be replaced. &nbsp; *&amp;$)(*@ </p>
<p>USB cable not yet installed.</p>
