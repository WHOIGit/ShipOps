========================================
<p>Prior to the Kongsberg visit March 2019, Phins offsets and lever arms were changed based on newest IMTEC survey.</p>

<p>These may have to be reverted if unable to perform a Patch Test or Casius in the near future.</p>

<p>Screen shots are documented on sssg_on_memory</p>

<p>Post-Change Vessel Misalignment: Heading 0.043, Roll -0.586, Pitch 0.086</p>

<p>Pre-Change COG lever arm: 0,0,0</p>

<p>Post-Change COG lever arm: -13.790, 0.453, 2.858 (based on Capt stability program 3 March 2019)</p>
