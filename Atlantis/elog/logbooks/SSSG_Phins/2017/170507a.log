<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Contacted IXblue regarding GPS1 rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We sent them data and explained that the phins system is/was rejecting the GPS1 (CNAV) data </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">almost continuously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This problem was trickling to the em122 and causing sudden position jumps in the data (see pictures attached).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">IXSea&rsquo;s diagnosis was that there was that the GPS1 was being rejected by their filter because the std. deviation formula, using the CNAV&rsquo;s very</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> small std. deviation was not being met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From section of PHINS manual:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;When an observation of external data is performed data can be accepted, rejected or attenuated by the Kalman filter.&nbsp; For example, when a GPS position is </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">received, distance &delta; between INS position and GPS position is calculated.&nbsp; If the distance is smaller than 3 times the quadratic sum of GPS position standard<br />
deviation and INS standard deviation the position is accepted.&nbsp; If the distance is greater than 5 times the quadratic sum of GPS position standard<br />
deviation and INS standard deviation the position is rejected.&nbsp; If the distance is within 3 to 5 times the quadratic sum of GPS position standard deviation<br />
and INS standard deviation, the position is attenuated by a factor &mu;.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From the description, it seems evident that the phins calculated position is the one that needs a larger std. deviation.&nbsp; <span style="font-family:Arial">Their solution was to have us change </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">the filter setting in the web-based IXSea interface (see attached for image of page to change - this is not a screenshot of our settings!).<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The setting for &ldquo;Limit Standard Deviation to at least&rdquo; was changed to 0.5 meters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This solution has made the phins stop rejecting the GPS1 data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">However, we are not sure whether this is a long term, viable solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems that the CNAV std deviation is low because it is highly accurate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Therefore, it would seem that the std. deviation that might be too low is that of the phins computed position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, why did this problem suddenly </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">surface, seemingly out of the blue (nothing had been changed for several weeks prior to the em122 skips, but maybe it was not noticed because </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">we didn&rsquo;t have the IXRepeater window open enough and the rejections weren&rsquo;t quite as frequent)?</span></p>
