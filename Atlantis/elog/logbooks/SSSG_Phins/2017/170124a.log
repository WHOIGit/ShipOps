========================================
<p>I do not really remember anything about heave filters prior to the latest firmware upgrade (Nov 2016) - I don't remember </p>
<p>a setting, but there is one now.&nbsp; We are presently using:</p>
<p>&quot;REAL TIME HEAVE&quot;&nbsp; for the filter setting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>************email from Robbie 23Jan2017 answering my question about this filter</p>
<p>I meant to respond to this, better late than never.<br />
<br />
&gt; Also, all of the phins ports are set to &quot;Real Time Heave Filter&quot;.&nbsp; I know we talked about this after the firmware upgrade (the other<br />
&gt; choice is Smart heave), but I don't remember what the thought was.&nbsp; Does that sound correct (the way it is configured, in the ports<br />
&gt; section one must select a heave filter - don't remember if there was a way to turn that off entirely, or if we wanted to).<br />
<br />
The Real Time heave is what it say, heave data in real time.&nbsp; (Real Time Heave Filter seems like a confusing term, as all heave data is<br />
filtered.&nbsp; It makes more sense to just say Real Time or Smart Heave)<br />
<br />
Smart heave is just IxBlue's term for delayed heave.&nbsp; Remember the HIPPIE?&nbsp; Basically, if you can look at the heave number both forward and<br />
backwards in time, you can get a more accurate heave when you average it.&nbsp; IXBlue uses a 100 second delay, so they must be looking 100<br />
seconds forward, and 100 seconds back.<br />
<br />
I don't know why we don't use Smart Heave.&nbsp; Seems like it would be more accurate.&nbsp; I guess EM122 is not set up for it.&nbsp; Perhaps you are<br />
expected to apply it in post processing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it's not that big a deal in a larger ship.&nbsp; Also, I don't need any more multibeam issues at<br />
the moment.&nbsp; :-)<br />
<br />
Some day we will also have to deal with the center of motion issue with the PHINS.&nbsp; But I'm quite certain that if that number is zero, our<br />
heave is not always correct.&nbsp; Also, zero is not really zero.&nbsp; Pretty sure the zero is not the same as &quot;off&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; By having zero entered, we<br />
are telling the system that the center of motion of the ship is at the PHINS.<br />
