========================================
<p>Updated PHINS firmware to version 10.1.3&nbsp; (not that any of the actual firmware numbers are anything like that.)</p>
<p>This was not a trivial process.&nbsp; First attempt failed, not sure why but probably because we did not repower the PHINS quickly enough.&nbsp; Second attempt failed as well.&nbsp; All but one of the files were loaded in the phins.&nbsp; Third time worked.&nbsp; Note, we did not simply keep trying.&nbsp; Numerous emails back to the factory as to what the next step was to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are attempting a firmware update, do it during a time frame when France is awake and not on holiday.&nbsp; Anyway, it all seems to be fine now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
