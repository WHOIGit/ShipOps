========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">In the j-box on the tank top level, there is a splitter available to split the output from SSSG phins port &quot;E&quot; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">This feed normally goes to the Sonardyne system.&nbsp; The splitter, when connected, will send the feed, also to the bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I believe the bridge feed is an emergency back-up for the DP system.&nbsp; The baud rate requirements happened to be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">the same as the Sonardyne feed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Initially, two wires were backward (after Lucky's installation).&nbsp; This did not get caught until the next Alvin cruise (at36) when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">the Sonardyne was missing its feed.&nbsp; Another - &quot;please check everything when your done&quot; moment</span></p>
