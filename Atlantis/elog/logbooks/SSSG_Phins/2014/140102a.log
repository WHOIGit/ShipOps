========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The CNAV 3050 antenna mount broke.&nbsp; When remounted, due to safety concerns it was mounted inboard of the catwalk railing.&nbsp; Therefore, there was a slight change in the lever arms for the phins.&nbsp; These changes were made in the phins around 02:00 GMT on 2014-January-2.</span></p>
