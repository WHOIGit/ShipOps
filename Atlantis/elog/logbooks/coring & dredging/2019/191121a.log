========================================
<p>Four Scripps dredges were borrowed for at42-20 at the request of the Chief Scientist. Photos of assembled dredges are attached as well as a chart and worksheets for calculating which weak links to choose. The inventory for the borrowed Scripps&nbsp;dredges included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bags of 3/8&rdquo; main link bolts
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>25 x 11,800 lbs</li>
		<li>25 x 13,700 lbs</li>
		<li>25 x 17,100 lbs</li>
		<li>12 x 19,000 lbs</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Bags of side link 7/16&quot; bolts
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>50 x 5,000 lbs</li>
		<li>50 x 8000 lbs</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>50 x burlap sacks</li>
	<li>4 x complete dredges (Ready to deploy with full sets of weak and main links, nets and weights)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 x completed and cut spare net</li>
	<li>2 pig weights</li>
	<li>3 x spare weak links (in addition to links on dredges in basket)
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>1 x main link (3/8&quot; bolt hole)</li>
		<li>2 x with main (3/8&quot;) and side link (7/16&quot;) bolt holes</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

========================================
<p>Developed by Justin Smith (UNOLS Tech) to best calculate weak link tensions and maximum tension to pull when on bottom based on wire out, water depth, etc. The Chief Mate now has a copy of this worksheet as well and it can be updated throughout the dredging operation based on weather, active or passive dredging operations, and changes in depth and wire out.</p>
