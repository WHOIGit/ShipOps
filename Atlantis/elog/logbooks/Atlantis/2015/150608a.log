========================================
<p><strong>SSSG data USBs</strong> - Data USB from vessel, shipboard data (2-3 cruises per USB)</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; the ship's give them to Rick</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; If multibean data Rick sends to Peter ELSE&nbsp;  If no multibeam data Rick send directly to Audrey</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; If there was multibeam data Peter sends to Audrey ELSE&nbsp; Audrey already has it from step 2</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) &nbsp; Audrey uploads to R2R and DLA (WHOI Archive).. maybe it is one upload and R2R gets it there..</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Audrey sends them back to Rick to be redistributed to the ships.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past I (Laura) have removed the cruise data and had them sent them back to ships as needed...<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>The Alvin data</strong> (I am a little fuzzy here)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Data from Alvin goes to Rick by whatever means is readily available and as safe as possible</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; Rick send it to Scotty</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Scotty sends the data to Audrey (not sure about the video)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; Audrey sends the disks back to Scott for cleaning?? or maybe she does it and then sends back to Rick and they go back to the ship?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: Yellow;">NOTE:&nbsp; from the ship - we have asked that (particularly Alvin data and video) data and video USB's be cleaned </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: Yellow;">before sent back to the ship.&nbsp; There has been much confusion in the past due to USB's coming back with &quot;stuff&quot; on them </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: Yellow;">and the tech's have changed over - making it difficult to know if they've been sent in or not</span></span></p>
<p>&gt; <br />
&gt; At one point we were putting a little route map on a sticker or an index card tucked into the jacket:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; ____ Rick<br />
&gt; ____ Peter (multibeam data included)<br />
&gt; ____ DLA<br />
&gt; ____ Rick<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
