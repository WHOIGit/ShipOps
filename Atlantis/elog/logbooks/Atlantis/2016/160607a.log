========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">This is information pertaining to an upcoming cruise that may be applicable on future cruises - good info to have during a pre-cruise meeting to at least breach the issue of shallow water stations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">**********************</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just to follow up on water and sewage concerns from the pre-cruise meeting for AT37-1.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It looks like we will be able to use the Orca to process our sewage while in Discovery Bay.&nbsp; Captain<br />
Al checked and it does not appear to be a special, no dump zone.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, unless we determine otherwise,<br />
we can plan on NOT making a sewage-pumping run every night and will be able to process the sewage on<br />
site. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Water is a different story.&nbsp; To review the numbers we talked about, the ship holds 12,000 gallons of<br />
potable water.&nbsp; We generally consume between 2500 and 3000 gallons per day.&nbsp; We cannot let the tank go<br />
dry so, with a safety margin, we can go 3 days without making water.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can make up to 8000 gallons<br />
per day but we need to be a significant distance offshore to do so (usually around 12 miles). <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These numbers are a bit subjective.&nbsp; Crew size and the implementation of water<br />
restrictions can have a significant impact on water consumption. &nbsp; <br />
If I understood correctly, there are 5 days on station for this cruise followed by a couple of days in<br />
port.&nbsp; To be safe, I&rsquo;d say we need to plan on a minimum of 36 hours of water making time throughout<br />
the cruise.&nbsp; &nbsp;This can be scheduled in small, 6-8 hour windows or one full day designated as a water<br />
making day. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yes, the scheduling of water making will happen with the Chief Sci, Captain and the Chief during the<br />
cruise.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important, however, that the Chief Sci knows ahead of time how many hours will<br />
potentially be needed for water making.&nbsp; It makes for a bad start to a cruise when they are hearing it<br />
for the first time from us. <br />
