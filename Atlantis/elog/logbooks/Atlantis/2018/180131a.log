========================================
<p><strong>AT39-04 Transit Worklist (list started at39-02 transit)</strong></p>

<p>(Not really in any kind of order, but stuff more towards the bottom not that high priority to get done on this cruise and can easily wait)</p>

<p>- <span style="color:#FF0000">WHOI -&nbsp; </span>-70 freezer in science hold &ndash; NEED SERVICE CALL AND NEW HEATER - ground fault &ndash; burnt another plug (turns out i was door heater again).&nbsp; Was never fixed last summer.&nbsp; Heaters are still disconnected from last then.&nbsp; Emailed david 2018-jan-30 about getting service call - Phil B (engineering) looked at it.&nbsp; The heater was hooked back up.&nbsp; Some question as to whether it was a new heater or old heater.&nbsp;<span style="color:#FF0000"> Steve W. (cheng) has ordered a new heater via NS5 and put in a request for a SLO-MO (or whatever it&#39;s called) service representative to come and install</span></p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">PR DAVE IN PR - </span>NAAMES - install check valve in underway sensor system like we had on the last NAAMES cruise.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color:#FF0000">ds will install in PR.&nbsp; I am bringing some new check valves to use.</span></p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">PR - AFTER VAN MOVE TO O1 deck - </span>NAAMES - put chimney on radvan (it is inside right now) &ndash; can&rsquo;t put on until we know if and where it will be moved to &ndash; supposed to go to O1 deck, but inboard or outboard?fx</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">END OF AT39-05 on way to PR - </span>NAAMES &ndash; zap flow thru with chlorine &ndash; Tim Bates would like the piping to the O2 deck zapped as well &ndash; open that pipe till chlorine smell comes</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">END OF AT39-05 on way to PR - </span>NAAMES - Pre-stage if possible/time permitting ethernet runs to forward vans for NAAMES.</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">AS ARRIVING IN PR - </span><span style="color:#000000">NAAMES - breakdown bench in BioLab and set up O2 titrator on other bench (breakdown aft one this time so titration not right in the way of Boss flow thru stuff)</span></p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE -</span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; check Milli-Q purity &ndash; needs to be 18.2MOhm water or change filter</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE - SET UP WITH SCIENCE GROUP - </span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; plankton nets and surface pump (where and what help do they need)? They are going on clean wire, so STBD side.&nbsp; May switch to boom instead of crane.</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE - DURING NEWCRUISE &#39; ing - </span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; increase chief sci mail filter to at least 2 Mb</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">CAPE VERDE - </span>HUTCHINS &ndash; putting FL on seawater system in a lab.&nbsp; How to monitor so sink won&rsquo;t overflow &ndash; should only need a trickle of water &ndash; our sump pump is missing.</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#FF0000">STARTED - </span>HUTCHINS CRUISE &ndash; need to get liquid nitrogen ready ahead for them &ndash; fill both dewars &ndash; if they are filling their dewars from our dewars (rather than 1 L pitcher) they need to bring it off the ship.&nbsp; STARTED LN2 SYSTEM 2018-Jan-25;&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">switched dewars 2018-Jan-28 &ndash; never went to full, but did not seem to still be transferring.&nbsp; Need to find out how high up on rod &ldquo;full&rdquo; is.&nbsp; Also checking on borrowing other dewar that Dave W. brought for OOI cruise (not his)</span></p>

<p>-stuff was moved around in the racks &ndash; the transducer board is not mounted, it is on top of the rack &ndash; not really sure why &ndash; where should it go now??&nbsp; It will block everything!</p>

<p>-hiseasnet spectrum analyzer &ndash; can&rsquo;t tune it in.&nbsp; Something is wrong</p>

<p>-Test IPcam software (Josh) - <span style="color:#FF0000">Josh said he tried to load the software and it requires a license.&nbsp; I thought it was on a 90-day free trial, but that was in Oct 2015 :O&nbsp; I emailed panasonic and asked if we can have a 90-day trial anyway. psditech@us.panasonic.com - email I got from live chatting</span></p>

<p>-Hiseasnet A/C maintenance</p>

<p>-Check valve in place of debubbler in bow thruster room - have possible check valve on my desk (allison) - maybe not quite right.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color:#FF0000">ds getting some different check valves on vacation.&nbsp; Will bring to San Juan. </span></p>

<p>-Make web guide for &ldquo;things to shut off in your phone/computer to not hog bandwidth&rdquo; &ndash;<span style="color:#FF0000"> 2018-Jan-20 - I posted one we got<a name="_GoBack"></a> via email about conserving bandwidth on ship website</span></p>

<p>-Figure out how to put TSS1 and separate heading feed into Sonardyne &ndash; why does heading have to be separate from attitude (is it just a matter of speed of receiving) &ndash; problem is actually that the phins port with heading is tied to 4800 baud due to GPS 1850 coming in there - <span style="color:#FF0000">can we get rid of GPS2 in phins?</span></p>

<p>-See about moving flybridge hive further forward to better cover bow &ndash; started to look at this &ndash; it is on the port side of flybridge &ndash; I</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(ds) have contacted Robbie about getting us some more external cable.&nbsp; When I installed the Hive, the piece of cable thatI had was spliced and was bad. &nbsp;&nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t have a piece long enough to place it properly and I got the &ldquo;no money&rdquo; reply.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll move it when we get to WHOI in the spring. 2018-jan-30<span style="color:#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp; - </span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color:#FF0000">I went up on flybridge and dug around in the chartroom overhead.&nbsp; I can not see that there is any excess cable there that would allow a move without re-running cable.&nbsp; It is hard to discern on the chartroom though.&nbsp; I might be wrong. (allison)&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color:#FF0000">ds - I will run a completely new cable when we get to WHOI in the spring.&nbsp; Robbie is getting some new cable for the run. </span></p>

<p>-RAD calibration - change wrong values?&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">emailed Robbie to check before changing - alliosn working on</span></p>

<p>-Label Alvin smart switch &ndash; ports &ndash; <span style="color:#FF0000">2018-Jan-29 &ndash; not ready to label, not really anything configured yet.&nbsp; Alvinites need to&nbsp; make a list of what they want on there.</span></p>

<p>BUC software &ndash; connected in radome???&nbsp; Status of running software?</p>

<p>************COMPLETE &ndash; below here&nbsp;</p>

<p><del>-finish documenting 2011 benchmarks in elog &ndash; done except for picure of PBM5 on flybridge (aft) - <span style="color:#FF0000">allison has all info, I (allison) just need to get a final photo and finish compiling info)</span></del></p>

<p>-<del>Test cyberoam blocking filters</del><span style="color:#FF0000"><del> - </del>when creating a new policy for the first time:&nbsp; if your policy is going to deny access to certain sites, start with the template &quot;Allow All&quot;;&nbsp; if your policy is going to only allow certain sites, start with the template &quot;deny all&quot;.&nbsp; I think the only time you can see which template you&#39;ve selected is when ou are creating the policy.&nbsp; There must be another way, but I haven&#39;t found it yet. </span></p>

<p><s>-remove old fiber run from computer lab to main lab alvin duping.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">I tested the new on, but am hesitant to remove the old until the new has been used for a while - maybe that is silly! changed my mind&nbsp; and removed the temporary</span></s></p>

<p>&nbsp;<del>Maggie &ndash; status of deck cable leaving hydrolab -</del> <span style="color:#FF0000">think it might actually be better to leave this just inside of hydrolab (ROV hangar door).&nbsp; otherwise it will just coorode anyway (Rox Bloc almost impossible to reach)</span></p>

<p>-<del>Re-run Alvin fiber computer lab to main lab<span style="color:#FF0000"> - working on this now _ dpne and tested - allison 2018-feb-1</span></del></p>

<p>-<del>serial card in new FTP &ndash; change???&nbsp; Lost ttyS7 while in use and did not return after reboot -<span style="color:#FF0000"> 2018-Jan-31 - when I looked today (dmesg | grep tty) it was there again.&nbsp; Need to try plugging multibeam sv feed back into that one and see if it is working.&nbsp; -ttyS7 is back working for no apparent reason!</span></del></p>
