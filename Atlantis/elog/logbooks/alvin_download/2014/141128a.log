========================================
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Alvin 24 port main switch has now been changed to 1Gb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the other switches in the blue cabinet, there is a gigabit switch that connects the Alvin net, the SSSG office, the Alvin Electronics shop, and the Alvin Download rack.&nbsp; This speeds up the download.&nbsp; Usually it won't matter, but the ext stills really go faster through there.</p>
