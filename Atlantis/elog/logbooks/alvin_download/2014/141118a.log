========================================
<p>&nbsp; I changed the power supply in the Shuttle computer that is on the table by the winch station.&nbsp; That seems to have been the problem all along.&nbsp; It turns out that those models had a 350W power supply that was actually only a couple of hundred watts, if that much.&nbsp; Anyway, replacing it with a new 45W PS has it all happy now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I put it on the table next to the winch station and mounted a monitor for it.&nbsp; We've been navigating our elevator drops from there by VNCing into Sonardyne..&nbsp; It's really handy there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; It is on the Alvin Network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; It is running Win7, but is dual booting back to XP.</p>

========================================
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>cleanse_data.pl </strong> on the C+C computer will gzip and move the data in /data to /data/Backups/pre-AL###.&nbsp; When running the script, you are prompted for the dive number.&nbsp; It has a default that you can just accept.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">This should be run about 0500 or so before the Alvin guys get busy on the sub.&nbsp; You can also re-run it later if needed.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>gocc</strong> is a script on the alvindata01 computer that will ssh you into the C+C computer.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>gonav</strong> is a script on the alvindata01 computer that will ssh you into the nav computer.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>cleanse_nav.pl</strong> is on the nav computer.&nbsp; It works like <strong>cleanse_data.pl</strong>.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; Often there is no overnight data in /data/nav to be cleaned out.&nbsp; It's probably a good idea to check first.<br />
