A Guide to Alvin Data Directories - updated 14 March 2016

Under the ATXX-XX cruise directory are individual directories for each dive in the format ALXXXX, along with the cumulative Framegrabber files for the entire cruise in the directory AFG_ATXX-XX.


-AFG_ATXX-XX:
	-The complete suite of framegrabber files for the entire cruise, including the dive_list.html browseable web interface.


-ALXXXX:
	-Audio: WMA files produced by the handheld digital audio recorders provided inside the sphere.
	
	-C+C: Engineering files produced by the pilot's Command and Control computer (linux) inside the sphere. A complete breakdown of each data record type can be found in the Alvin_Data_Formats0.2.xls, also located in this document directory.

	-ExtStillCam: Time lapse photographs or short video clips produced by the External Science Camera, usually mounted on the starboard manipulator arm.

	-Imagenex: Any files logged by the Imagenex computer (Windows) inside the sphere.
		-Imagenex: Data produced by the Imagenex sonar
		-Temperature_Logs: 1Hz logs produced from the temperature probes located on the port window, starboard window, and science basket. 
	
	-IntStills: Photos taken with the handheld cameras inside the sphere by the science observers and/or pilot.

	-nav: Navigation and engineering files produced by the pilot's Navigation computer (linux) inside the sphere. A complete breakdown of each data record type can be found in the Alvin_Data_Formats0.2.xls, also located in this document directory.
		-*.png or *.jpg: Underlays used for in-sphere navigation during the dive.
		-*.tgt: Location of targets entered either during the pre-dive process or manually entered during the course of the dive.

	-Science: Any files logged by the Science computer (Windows) inside the sphere.
		-Temperature_Logs: 1Hz logs produced from the temperature probes located on the port window, starboard window, and science basket.
		-CTD: 4Hz CTD records produced by a SBE49 CTD. The ultimate source of these logs is the C+C computer, however the parsed and consolidated data product is found here in the CTD directory.

	-Toplab_Navest: Navigation and engineering files produced by the Atlantis Surface Control Navigation computer (linux). A complete breakdown of each data record type can be found in the Alvin_Data_Formats0.2.xls, also located in this document directory.
		-*.png or *.jpg: Underlays used for Surface Control navigation during the dive.
		-*.tgt: Location of targets entered either during the pre-dive process or manually entered during the course of the dive by the Surface Controller.

	-USBL: Raw log files of USBL navigation data produced by the Sonardyne Ranger USBL system located in Atlantis Surface Control.
