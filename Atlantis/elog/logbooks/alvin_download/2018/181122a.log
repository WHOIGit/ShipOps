========================================
<p>I was attempting to run sealog_predive.sh on c+c and pretty much every step gives me an error &quot;Failed to<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; connect to localhost port 8000: Connection refused&quot;</p>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>

<p>&gt; The port 8000 error means the sealing server on the c+c machine isn&rsquo;t running. To start it you can either restart the c+c machine or goto http://&lt;c+c IP address&gt;:9001<br />
&gt; and click the &ldquo;start&rdquo; link next to sealog_server.</p>

<p>In this particular case (19-Aug-2018) Catie got the Alvinites to reboot c&amp;c computer and that took care of it.</p>
