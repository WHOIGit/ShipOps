========================================
<p>We started having level wind issues early in 2018.&nbsp; The cable would jump at the aft cheek at just under 650 meters payout (at that time).&nbsp; Usually, slowing down just before reaching that point and staying at a slower payin speed until well past the cheek provided good wraps.&nbsp; Since then, the problem has been investigated by Rick Trask.&nbsp; Here is his email:</p>

I was on the Atlantis this morning and spoke with Patrick Hennessy&nbsp;<br />
followed by a conversation with Jenn Hickey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick indicated that&nbsp;<br />
there is a problem with the .322 cable level winding properly as the&nbsp;<br />
last 500 meters of cable are wound onto the drum.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable is&nbsp;<br />
NSF-13-C165.&nbsp;&nbsp;The visible cable has a degree of surface rust which is to&nbsp;<br />
be expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of the level wind problem is not well&nbsp;<br />
understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick does not think it is related to the winch drum&nbsp;<br />
itself but rather the wire which could have a small variation in&nbsp;<br />
diameter possibly due to rust.&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulative affect of a small&nbsp;<br />
increase in diameter could impact the level wind.</p>

<p>I measured the cable diameter in 5 places about a meter apart where the&nbsp;<br />
cable was easily accessible using a three point caliper.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5&nbsp;<br />
measurements were .328&quot;, .330&quot;, .328&quot;, .330&quot;, and .328&quot; with an average&nbsp;<br />
diameter of .329&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;When this cable was new the diameter measurements&nbsp;<br />
made by the manufacturer throughout its length were on average between&nbsp;<br />
.322&quot; and .323&quot;. The wet end of the cable is therefore between .006&quot; and&nbsp;<br />
.007&quot; greater in diameter than it was when it was new.&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulative&nbsp;<br />
affect of .006&quot; with every 115&plusmn; wraps is nearly 0.7&quot; which could&nbsp;<br />
certainly impact the level wind during the last fleet. The assumption is&nbsp;<br />
that all 115&plusmn; wraps have the same increase in diameter which certainly&nbsp;<br />
may not be the case. However the ship has most recently had problems&nbsp;<br />
with the level wind during the last fleet on the drum which is the end&nbsp;<br />
of the cable that is exposed to the elements the most as it sits on deck&nbsp;<br />
and is the end that sees the most seawater.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if only half of the&nbsp;<br />
wraps in the last fleet have wire that has grown in diameter due to the&nbsp;<br />
corrosion process the accumulative affect would be the equivalent of one&nbsp;<br />
wire diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly enough to throw off the level wind.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of my conversation with Jenn the plan was to do a deep&nbsp;<br />
CTD cast and if the level wind problem re-occurred during the last fleet&nbsp;<br />
then it would be advisable to cut the cable back approximately 500 m.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;<br />
would suggest a slight modification to that plan if time and conditions&nbsp;<br />
permit based on my subsequent measurements. &nbsp;&nbsp;The ship might consider&nbsp;<br />
making some diameter measurements over the last 750 meters or so to&nbsp;<br />
understand at what point they become excessive and impact the level&nbsp;<br />
wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal being to not cut too much cable back if it is not&nbsp;<br />
necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future efforts to apply a corrosion inhibitor will only help&nbsp;<br />
slow the deterioration.</p>

<p>Hi Rick and all,</p>

<p>This sounds to be a logical and fine approach to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Rick and all involved in talking over the issues with<br />
this .322 wire on Atlantis and the measuring the wire diameters to provide these recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m supportive of<br />
approach.</p>
