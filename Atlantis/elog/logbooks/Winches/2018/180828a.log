========================================
<p>*IFFY* spot on .322&quot; wire noticed during lubing (August 2018).&nbsp; It looked like the wire unwound a bit and stayed.&nbsp; THere is a bulge and a slight kink.&nbsp; Once wire was cut off the end, this spot sits at ~850 meters payout.&nbsp; It is right at the aft cheek.&nbsp; Catie said she had a problem winding at this spot, at least once, during a CTD cast.</p>

I was away for a few days and just saw your email.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think it will impact the strength of the wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under load hopefully all<br />
the outer armor wires will share the load evenly but it is definitely an area worth watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any record of a specific<br />
activity with that amount of wire out, like towing something?&nbsp;&nbsp;Something must have caused the wire to rotate at that point.<br />

&gt; Hi Rick,<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; With about 1000 meters remaining we came across an anomaly in the wire (see attached).&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like the wire is slightly unwound<br />
&gt; in this area. Jen is marking the position with paint so we can find it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can megger the conductors after everything else<br />
&gt; is done and see how they are. But, what do you feel about the strength of the wire in lieu of this anomaly?<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; Thanks,<br />
