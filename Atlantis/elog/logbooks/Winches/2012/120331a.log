========================================
<p>Robbie, Rob, Allison, Dave, et al,<br />
The WHOI SSSG load cell custom produced by 3PSInc has the following specs, taken from<br />
the 3PSINC drawing &quot;LP-5K-2008-0&quot;.<br />
The load pin can be powered directly from a SBE9 or any source from 10 to 15 VDC, and<br />
draws under 15mA across that range.<br />
You should be aware of the orientation of the load scribe on the load cell case,<br />
which allows alignment of the load pin to the mount so that the strain is properly<br />
applied across the sensing bridge.<br />
<br />
We have no prepared cables for this cell. Simply use an Impulse or Subconn MCIL4F<br />
with MCDLSF locking sleeve.<br />
Since this is being used with an SIO SBE9, the connection of this cell should be left<br />
with Rob Palomares.?<br />
If an MCIL4F pigtail or locking sleeve are required, contact Dave Wellwood (x2657) or<br />
George Tupper (x2683).<br />
<br />
Rob Palomares can setup a voltage channel on their SBE9 to provide for this load cell<br />
output. A simple two-term equation can fully describe the load cell voltage output to<br />
tension in pounds. The unit produces 1.000 volts output per 1,000 lbs tension.<br />
