========================================
<p>MXO4 s/n 4.690 with Burton connectors: went off the ship to Meridian to die in early 2016.</p>
<p>MXO4 s/n 29.379 with Burton connectors was removed from service August 2016 after a track record of usually good but<br />
occasionally suspect behavior (it had been uninstalled and re-installed a couple of times over a few years due<br />
to this). </p>
<p>MXO6 s/n 7.25 with Mecca connectors (an old Oceanus relic) is in place now, and it is clear some of<br />
the pairs are starting to go, and red-green is pretty shot. </p>
<p>MXO6 s/n 24.9 with Mecca connectors (the other Oceanus relic) is also aboard, but it has only 6 inch mecca pigtails on it, making for a highly impractical<br />
connection to the winch drum (too short to fully make it out of the other side of the drum collar, but too long to mate effectively inside the drum collar. Splicing new longer meccas on there would probably make the overall diameter of the cables too thick for the drum collar).</p>
<p>New-looking one of the plastic-no-serial-number type: to be installed, when megged in line with 0.322 on the drum so far looks to be in great shape.<br />
