Hi all,<br />
<br />
Attached are updated MSDS sheets and VGP info for the StranCore and / or OLL-D2<br />
Lube / Corrosion Inhibitor used on the .322 and other wire and cable aboard ship.<br />
StranCore &amp; OLL-D2 are essentially the same thing. They are just marketed<br />
differently. I have both products on hand.&nbsp; I have also included some additional<br />
documentation that you should keep on hand aboard ship.<br />
<br />
How is the cable looking now?&nbsp; Still silky smooth?&nbsp; Still getting drip off?<br />
Hopefully it is not too bad a mess for you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Chris<br />

<p>See email trail from end of July 2014 (around the 24th)</p>
<p>Catie and all,<br />
<br />
I noted these &quot;gaps&quot; in the outer armor of the cable before we began spooling and<br />
during spooling.&nbsp; And so did Markey.&nbsp; They were doing their own documentation of it<br />
and the whole process.<br />
I will also forward your email and the pictures to Rick Trask / UNOLS Wire Pool.<br />

&gt; <br />
&gt; We have a few casts under our belt so far, wire is still shiny and new, the amount<br />
&gt; of StranCore coming off on deck now is relatively little.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; I am attaching a couple pics of the wire I took upon leaving Astoria, I just wanted<br />
&gt; to document and ask you about the small &quot;gaps&quot; in the outer armor layer that are<br />
&gt; pervasive throughout the length of the wire. All along the length there are very<br />
&gt; short gaps between strands of the outer armor where the inner armor is visible<br />
&gt; below. This should be visible in &quot;WireMacro.jpg&quot;. In the &quot;WireSpool.jpg&quot; shot of<br />
&gt; the entire drum you can see it extending throughout the length of the wire and even<br />
&gt; down onto the fleet below.<br />
