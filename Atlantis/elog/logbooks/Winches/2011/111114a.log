========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">A short discussion of the temperature effects on resistance of the sea cable, if<br />
you're interested-<br />
<br />
When warm, the continuity resistance readings will increase and often the<br />
insulation resistance will decrease.<br />
<br />
The continuity readings you observed are reasonable, and the insulation resistance<br />
values are acceptable.<br />
<br />
You observed 293 to 294 ohms resistance end-to-end, termination to lab, for each of<br />
the three conductors of the sea cable.&nbsp; From the A301592 cable data sheet and<br />
recorded length of the cable, you determined that the sea cable alone should read<br />
301.96 ~ 302.0 ohms. The Rochester specification is determined for new production<br />
cable at 20 deg C.<br />
<br />
Temperatures different from 20deg C will change the resistance, as well<br />
work-hardening of the conductors from use.<br />
<br />
We do not have the slipring or lead-in resistance readings, but in my experience<br />
from the 2009 SDSL Data-Link initial tests these are typically:<br />
slip rings, per channel, at 10mA DC, &lt; 0.01 ohm.<br />
lead in on Atlantis, from slip ring lead-in side to terminal block in Computer lab,<br />
0.42 ohms at 25C guesstimated average temperature.<br />
... total contribution of lead in on Atlantis from slip rings and lead-in to series<br />
resistance for each leg would be under 0.5 ohms as measured in 2009.<br />
If we neglect work hardening for a moment, and look only at the temperature<br />
coefficient of resistivity, I would guess that the A301592 cable was cooler than 20<br />
deg C when the reading was taken. Maybe about 14 C...? Is that the case?<br />
<br />
It is difficult to estimate the average temperature of the cable on the winch drum.<br />
For JASON work we use an infrared thermometer to take multiple reading on the<br />
inside and outside of the drum and average these. Obviously this is to watch for<br />
hot spots due to the large power dissipation in the fiberoptic cable, and not to<br />
determine continuity, but I have used the infrared thermometer to take multiple<br />
readings on A301592 cable and compare calculated end-to-end resistance from<br />
correcting for temperature coefficient of resistivity, with the actual readings of<br />
the wire alone, end to end, without slip rings or lead-in. These readings do<br />
correspond pretty well.<br />
<br />
The equation for resistance correction, for temperature other than 20 C, is:<br />
<br />
R1 = R2 * [ 1 + a * (T1 - T2)]<br />
where:<br />
R1 = resistance at 20 C.<br />
R2 = resistance at new temperature C.<br />
a = 0.0039/C, the temperature coefficient of resistance of annealed copper at 20C<br />
(note 1).<br />
T1 = 20 C, the reference temperature.<br />
T2 = observed temperature in C.<br />
<br />
Note 1- see National Bureau of Standards Handbook 100, Copper Wire Tables, 1966,<br />

<br />
Now assume that the &quot;average&quot; temperature of the A301592 cable wound on the drum<br />
has stabilized at 14 ?C, a guess for your position now off to the West of Gibraltar,<br />
and, assume that you observed the resistance of one conductor to be 294 ohms at that<br />
time.<br />
<br />
The expected resistance at 20 C can be found by applying the equation above is<br />
shown here:<br />
<br />
T1 = 20.0 C<br />
T2 = 14.0 C<br />
a = 0.0039/C<br />
R1 = expected resistance in ohms when corrected to 20 C.<br />
R2 = 294, observed resistance in ohms at 14 C.<br />
<br />
R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1-T2)]<br />
R1 = 294 * [1 + 0.0039/C * (20.0C - 14.0C)]<br />
R1 = 294 * (1 + 0.0039/C * (6C)]<br />
R1 = 294 * [1 + 0.0234] = 294 * [1.0234]<br />
R1 = 300.8<br />
Now add the series resistance of the lead-in and slip rings I determined in 2009<br />
(assuming it is still valid), adding 0.5:<br />
<br />
R1 total circuit = 300.8 sea cable at 14 C + 0.5 for lead in and slip rings...<br />
<br />
R1 = 301.3 .<br />
<br />
I thank you for your diligence in making this test and sharing the results. Good<br />
work!<br />
<br />
A small correction- in the example I worked below, R1 should read:<br />
<br />
&quot;R1 total circuit = 300.8 sea cable when corrected to 20 C + 0.5 for lead in and<br />
slip rings...&quot;</span><br />
