========================================
<p>Poor megger readings noted following pre-AT31 termination completed on 10 Oct 15 by DS.</p>
<p>On 4 Nov 15 I traced source of poor megger to slip ring serial # 4.690.</p>
<p>Resistance measurements on the bench for just the 6 slip ring pairs were: 2.5 G, 1.6 G, 1.45 G, 800 M, 245 M, and 209 M. ***Slip ring sent ashore 5 Dec 2015 for repair. Megs fine on bench after 1 month of &quot;drying out&quot;, but suspect will fail again in the field. Had similar issues with it in 2014.</p>
<p>Swapped in serial #29.379. New resistance measurements for entire path, termination to lab are now:</p>
<p>R-G = 2.85 G</p>
<p>W-G = 2.09 G</p>
<p>B-G = 2.70 G</p>
<p>R-W = 4.01 G</p>
<p>R-B = 4.18 G</p>
<p>B-W = 4.21 G</p>
