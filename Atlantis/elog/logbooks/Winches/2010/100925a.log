========================================
<p>The slip ring on the CTD winch was replaced (symptoms - science using two conductor wires for running some pumps on the CTD, were having intermittency issues.&nbsp; We have also had some noise in the O2 data and one instance during one cast where the data flatlined - we did not get any error messages though).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bad slip ring serial number is:&nbsp; 6.607&nbsp; Model MX-0-4/MM</p>
