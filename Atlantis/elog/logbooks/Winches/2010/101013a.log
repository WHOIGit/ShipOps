========================================
<p>Marshall tested the cable:</p>
<p>He used the AEMC 1060 s/n 208034FMDV megohmmeter for the tests. All<br />
tests were run for at least 10 minutes at 250VDC applied voltage to<br />
get the DAR and PI readings for the conductors.<br />
<br />
Atlantis bridge wire log shows the following entries for this sea cable:<br />
latest cut for retermination on 9/29/2010:&nbsp; 9930m<br />
axle end reading on installation 9/09/2010: 0073m<br />
resulting length of sea cable:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9857m<br />
<br />
Test results:<br />
<br />

1.197 uF.<br />
<br />
2. Insulation resistance lead-to-lead&nbsp; (for SDSL inter-lead insulation<br />
test results)<br />
White to Black:<br />
(black on negative, white on positive)<br />
2.645 gigohms.<br />
1.04 DAR<br />
1.01 PI<br />
0.715 uF.<br />
<br />
3. Loop resistance measurement for SDSL Data-Link:<br />
White+Black, with white and black leads connected at termination.<br />
608 ohms, measured with the 400kohm setting on the AEMC 1060, with<br />
temperature of the wound sea cable estimated at 18C.<br />
