========================================
<p>Bosun took off about 500 meters of cable.&nbsp; 50 meters from inner section wrapped up to be sent to Chris Griner for pull testing (placed in the N2 generator van).&nbsp; The new length (we don't know what the actual start number is on the innermost section of the reel, so this could be off up to 200 meters) is 7332 meters.</p>
