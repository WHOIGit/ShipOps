========================================
<p>All,<br />
<br />
The attached file documents results of the electrical test done by me Apr 2 2013 for the Rochester A302351 fiberoptic/electrical sea cable onboard Atlantis.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've added the two-page Rochester spec sheet for this cable to the file. Also attached is a PDF of a blank Underwater Cable Electrical Test Record for future use.</p>

    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">Yesterday (4/2/2013) I cut off 2m of the wet end of the FO cable, and then prepared the electrical and fiber optic conductors for testing.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The cable has been reterminated without any wet-end fitting, for doing in-water testing of the Alvin Observation Vehicle.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">All three fiber optic leads at the wet end have been prepared, but only the red and black have been polished and tested usable with less than 7.0dB loss at 1300nm wavelength.&nbsp;</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">All three FO leads in the winch flange Jbox were loose in the box and without any tip protectors. These must always be installed and leads secured.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">All three 11AWG electrical circuits have been insulation tested and pass with not less than 10G&Omega; at 1000VDC to armor or between any other lead.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The Focal Technologies opto-electrical slip ring s/n 176870P was mounted by me and John Bailey.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">Four leads of the 3kv circuit in the slip rings were used with the winch, providing all three inner conductors (slip ring lead ID #1, #2, #3), along with a lead for the armor connection (#4). These were connected as Green lead to #1, White #1 lead to #2, White #2 lead to #3, and armor to #4.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">At the winch slipring junction box, the slip ring electrical leads were connected onto the glass-epoxy perfboard studs, and wired to the A302351 jumper cable segment leading from the slip-rings to the ALVIN storage room and the Dahl 3kv transformer in stainless steel box.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">Details of connection of the AOV to the computer lab and the winch room will be provided by John Bailey.</li>

<p style="border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; "><b>Action needed after AOV tests</b>: Unfortunately, due to my upcoming leave, I will be unable to complete the following items I think are essential. I leave this list for SSSG/ALVIN/Atlantis to add to their worklist as available. There are no safety related items needing attention that I am aware of.</p>
<ol style="border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; ">
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The end-to-end resistance of the A302351 cable should be measured, along with recording the temperature of the drum at the measurement time, and compared to the design specification.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The end-to-end resistance of all seven conductors of the slip ring should be checked and recorded. There are four 3KV leads, and three 600V leads.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The end-to-end resistance of the lead-in from Computer lab to slip ring Jbox should be checked for all leads to it and recorded.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The slip ring mounting blocks and spacers must be re-aligned with the slip rings. Presently they cannot place the slip rings in axial alignment with the axle end of the drum. Not far off, but they do require work, likely about 5-10mm of shims at the bottom of the mount clamps to provide proper vertical alignment. The fore/aft alignment looks good.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The white FO lead ST connector at the axle end must be made up again. It was discovered broken, but it was not needed for the tests.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">One of the single-mode leads from the Computer lab to the winch room has been damaged from kinking. John used a splint to keep it oriented, but the lead will need re-terminated with a new ST connector.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">All three leads in the lab to winch room should be tested for loss and mechanical damage, and replaced if necessary.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">The electrical/fiber-optic Jbox beside the slip ring, mounted on the horizontal cross-brace, should be replaced with a new box.&nbsp;</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px; ">Several circuits of multimode and singlemode fiber are in bundles which were brought through Dorn fittings but may not be usable any more. This should be identified, and removed if not needed, else it will continue to clutter the Jbox and the mount.</li>
