========================================
<p>2014-April-15</p>
<p>One of the fish-hooks snaggled in the sheave during a CTD cast.&nbsp; That fishhook is now much longer than before!&nbsp; We've also removed wire since the last recording, so the relative position has changed.</p>
<p>fishhook #1 at ~1428-1430 meters</p>
<p>fishhook #2 at ~ 1780 meters all the way to 1850 meters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****OLDER INFO</p>
<p>The fishhooks in the conductor wire were observed at payouts of:</p>
<p>fishhook #1&nbsp; at 1504 meters</p>
<p>fishhook #2 at 1861 meters</p>
<p>These were first observed during the spring of 2012.</p>
