&gt; Detailed below are the instructions for the wire cutter. If they are not clear please let me know as this was<br />
&gt; written fairly quickly. I can also send a chart to detail how to cut at different depths. Drawings can also be<br />
&gt; provided.<br />

&gt; SSSG Hydrostatic Pressure Actuated Wire Cutter<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; The shipped contents are the cutter cylinder (assembled), counter weight, spare blade, extra shear pins.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; To assemble the unit the wire should be slack. Place wire into the 1 in groove (wire guide) on the counterweight's<br />
&gt; body. Fit the cutter body onto the counterweight so the cutter slot lines up with the small groove cut into the wire<br />
&gt; guide. The two 6 in long bolts go into through the counterweight and screw into the cutter body. The wire should<br />
&gt; then be tightened and the cutter can be released to slide down the wire. Tension should be kept on the wire to help<br />
&gt; the unit slide down the wire. This should also give an indication when the wire has been cut. I am estimating that<br />
&gt; it will fall at 2 m/s. But that is only an educated guess.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; For the spectra it may be necessary to ?jiggle? the wire to complete the cut. In the pressure chamber test a few<br />
&gt; strands did not cut. The jiggling should help the cutter cut all the way through the line.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; The shear pin that is currently installed in the cutter should shear at 850 m (1250 psi). The hole size is 0.193 in.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; In General each solid pin installed will add 1150 m (1700 psi)&nbsp; to the needed depth to actuate the piston. The two<br />
&gt; spare pins with holes (0.128 in) will add 1020 m (1500 psi) to the needed depth to actuate the piston.<br />
