<p>New insulation and continuity testing done for .322 cable to have on file. New .322 cable approved given current length is only 6603 meters. Notes on testing - a new test duration was recommended by Marshall Swartz of 5.0 minutes instead of 10.0 minutes. This setting was updated on the AEMC 1060 unit and a label put in place on the unit as well.</p>
