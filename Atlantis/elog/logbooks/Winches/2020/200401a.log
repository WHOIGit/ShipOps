<p>Allison and Phil --<br />
Both slip rings were offloaded last Friday. &nbsp;They are currently on a pallet together and stored in the warehouse under my name and ALVIN. &nbsp;I have created a spreadsheet of all items we<br />
stored in the warehouse during the offload, and we will use that to make sure all items are returned to the ship in 2021. &nbsp;There are a couple of other AT items included on this list that<br />
Catfish thought should be kept with the ALVIN gear, like the A-frame personnel ladder and swing bridge. &nbsp;We&#39;ll make sure they are repatriated as well.</p>

<p>&gt; Hi again (and for the first time Rick),<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; The Atlantis slipring is not in the weight area, near the alvin battery room or back in the winch room, so it must have been moved off with the Alvin slipring. &nbsp;I will search the pier<br />
&gt; area, but my guess is it went wherever the Alvin slipring went. &nbsp;Rick - would you know where that is? If so, can we re-direct to SSSG at some point over the coming months?<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; Thanks,<br />
