<p>Here is the write up that TJ McDermott had provided on the limits of the motion compensation on our vessels:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motion Compensation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The motion compensation used on the CAST6 hydro winch is not intended to hold perfect depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was designed to mitigate tension excursions on the line caused by ship&rsquo;s<br />
motion in water.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAST6 system takes a position snapshot when motion compensation is activated and will try to return to that position over time as winch inhauls and<br />
pays out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion compensation is an automatic function so is speed-limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed limit can be adjusted on the utility screen of the HMI in the aft control<br />
station.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I last looked at the system, it was set to 60 or 70 meters per minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed limit applies to the velocity command to the drum drive so is the sum of<br />
all speeds being applied to the winch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, assume the following conditions:</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Package currently at 100 meters depth.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast depth 3,000 meters.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast speed 40 meters per minute.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion compensation is active.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic modes speed limit is 60 meters per minute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>60 meters per minute maximum speed minus 40 meters per minute cast speed leaves only 20 meters per minute available for motion compensation in the payout direction.&nbsp;<br />
Motion compensation in the inhaul direction can reach the full 60 meters per minute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The speed limit is there because of lessons re-learned about .322 wire during sea trials of the CAST6 prototype aboard Roger Revelle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first cast was made with no<br />
speed limit in place and in impressive sea state (to this inexperienced civilian).&nbsp;&nbsp;Winch speeds exceeded 100 meters per minute during motion compensation tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br />
.322 wire came back aboard with some impressive bird-caging; about 100 meters of ruined cable had to be cut away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
