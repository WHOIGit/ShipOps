========================================
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Tests at the company revealed that the slipring was malfunctioning at high humidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We ahve only one of the sliprings with the Burton 6600 series connectors - as per Catie (below)</span></p>

<p>I'm not sure what credit on the connectors means, but anyway.<br />
<br />
We are down to only 1 Meridian MXO-4 slip ring with the Burton 6600 series connectors on either end that mate with the<br />
cables that run up through the winch deck from the lab, and that is the one installed now.<br />
<br />
We still have 2 spare Meridian MXO-6's from the Oceanus onboard with meccas on either end that should be in ok shape. So<br />
while not ready-spares, they are here.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have a ready drop-in spare of the MXO-4 with like connectors, but perhaps we should just order up<br />
some extra pigtails to make a couple Burton-Mecca adapters for the time being.<br />

&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Rick,<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry it appears there was some miscommunication on the<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback of this.&nbsp; The last tests we have run in humidity were<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; able to replicate the failures that were experienced by Catie in<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the field.&nbsp; That being said, the unit was manufactured and sold<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in August 1994 - making it over 20 years old and a bit outside<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the warranty window, and there isn't much we can do in terms<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of repair since the internals are legacy parts which we no<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longer stock or manufacture.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish I can return the unit to you to keep as a spare to<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use in &quot;desperate&quot; times, or dispose of the unit free of charge<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - offering a $50 credit on the connectors.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you Rick.<br />

Hi Cory-<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you are referring to s/n 4.690.<br />
<br />
When this unit was initially uninstalled from the winch and had been sitting out in the weather, on a couple of the pairs<br />
I was getting megger readings in the neighborhood of ~200 MOhms (the remaining pairs were 800 MOhm to 2.5 GOhm). After it<br />
had sat inside on the bench for several weeks, the pairs that had previously measured ~200 MOhms returned up to at least<br />
1 GOhm. I believe this occured once previously with this unit also, ie it was performing poorly when installed and<br />
exposed to the elements but regained its functionality after presumably &quot;drying out&quot; on the bench. It was reinstalled<br />
then again recently, but only to fail again a short time later.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any additional questions.<br />
<br />

&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per our conversation, can you forward my questions to the<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate personal?<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I am not seeing anything wrong with the unit, minus<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some cosmetic issues. At this point, the unit has passed our<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continuity test, insulation resistance test, and rotational<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; test. Can you provide a short description of the issues you were<br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experiencing with the MXO-4?<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any additional information will be much appreciated.<br />
