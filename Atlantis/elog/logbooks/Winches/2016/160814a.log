========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The MC400 requires a special termination so that there is wire below the shackle the weight is supported</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">on that can be bungee-ed to the frame so that it will take up the slack when the multicore hits the bottom and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">triggers.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The termination also needed to work with the CTD for casts (switching between as cameras and data on the MC400</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">needed the conductors).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The starting point for the Dead-end termination that was added above the regular poured termination was located</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">140&quot; above the poured termination (bottom where it fastens to the CTD).&nbsp; This dimension also worked for the distance </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">between the starting points of both Dead-end terminations when we had to re-terminate and two dead-ends were used </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">(rather than a dead-end and a poured).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">A doubled up bungee was attached 92&quot; above the bottom termination (either poured, where attaches to CTD or dead-end style</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">where the starting point for putting it on the wire is).&nbsp; That bungee was also attached to the MC400 frame leaving about 20.5&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">of bungee between the connections (when the bungee was in the slack position).</span></p>
