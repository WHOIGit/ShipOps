<br />
-Slip ring s/n 176870P, with -1- single mode fiber and -3- multimode fibers (all currently<br />

single mode fibers.<br />
<br />
-There is one single mode -breakout- cable that runs from the slip ring jbox in the winch room<br />
to the computer lab forward. It contains 4 single mode fibers.<br />
<br />
-Jason has a single mode and multimode breakout cable with 4 fibers each that run from the<br />

<p>Hi John-<br />
<br />
I'm attaching a photo of the conductors inside the slipring.<br />
There is one singlemode (yellow), 3 multimode (gray), 4 heavy gauge conductors (red), and 2<br />
thinner conductors (orange).<br />
<br />
The j-box mounted on the side of the drum has notation on it that it contains a multimode to<br />
single mode repeater (picture attached), but I can't really tell you anything more about it<br />
than that.&nbsp; It does not appear to be connected to anything presently on the slip ring or the<br />
.681 end.<br />
