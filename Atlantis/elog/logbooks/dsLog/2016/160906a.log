Hi Chad,<br />
<br />
Just an FYI of what I know about the Ship's data.<br />
<br />
We, SSSG,<br />
* rsync the ship's data back to shore for data checks.<br />
* make the gps data available to WHOI's webdev group.<br />
* send data to SAMOS (all underway data)<br />
* send data to NOAA (subset, but includes lat and lon)<br />
<br />
The WHOI weddev group takes the data and plots it up as the shiptracker.<br />
<br />
R2R<br />
* rsyncs the R2R ELOG data to shore that includes a 10 second GPS snapshot<br />
<br />
The ship's (both the Atlantis and Armstrong)<br />
* AIS (http://www.marinetraffic.com) which is the Port Office/Marine ops. I don't even know if it can be turned off, it<br />
could be a safety thing, but this is public. * Not sure if the ships still send weather data to NOAA<br />
* I think they also send lat and lon etc back to the port office (I don't think this goes any where else)<br />
<br />
The data policy that science signs says that the gps data is 'open' and the science party signed the doc w/ out saying<br />
anything about the underway data. It is in bold &quot;Embargo periods are not available for navigation.......&quot;.<br />
<br />
If it all needs to be shutdown again I *think* it would be easiest to:<br />
* have the webdev group stop plotting the ship that is 'embargoed'<br />
* we (SSSG) take away the availability of the data here on shore<br />
* the techs turn off the 'emailing' of the data to SAMOS and NOAA<br />
* I don't know about AIS or weather data to NOAA<br />
<br />
There are lots of pieces and parts and I am sure that there will be more as more data gets automagically sent to shore.<br />
<br />
thanks, laura<br />
