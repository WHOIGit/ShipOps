========================================
<p>I think this all got changed back! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changed the input port number on rmb_feeder.pl from 55005 to 55000.&nbsp; We are currently using the fwd 1850 as switched gps, and it was causing noise with having two serial connections (one for gps and one for the rmb string from the 1850).&nbsp; Will investigate more.</p>
