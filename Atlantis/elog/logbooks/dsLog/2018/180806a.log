========================================
<p>I removed the extended serial cards from teh old atdatalog01 and installed them in the new.&nbsp; I found a linux driver online for it (driv_linux_smart_v1.16_build_14030317.tgz - put copy in dslog directory on memory) and instructions:</p>

<p>Linux Driver Installation<br />
1. Execute the following commands from the Linux prompt:<br />
#mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom<br />
#cd /<br />
#mkdir moxa<br />
#cd moxa</p>

<p>#cp /mnt/cdrom/&lt;driver directory&gt;/mxser.tgz .<br />
#tar xvfz mxser.tgz<br />
2. #cd mxser<br />
#make clean; make install<br />
3. #cd /moxa/mxser/driver<br />
#./msmknod<br />
4. #modprobe mxser<br />
5. Use the Moxa diagnostic utility to verify the driver status:<br />
#cd /moxa/mxser/utility/diag<br />
#./msdiag<br />
6. Use the Moxa terminal utility to test the tty ports:<br />
#cd /moxa/mxser/utility/term<br />
#./msterm<br />
I varied a bit from the directions as I had a file I copied over not a file on CD.&nbsp; See pictures of board below.</p>

<p>The driver worked perfectly and reassigned all the devices to the right names like &quot;ttyM1&quot;.</p>

<p>There were copies of dsLog &amp; dsLogCSV on the computer in /usr/local/src - I had to do the rest of the build steps though, and copy the .ini files over from the atdatalog02 computer.</p>

<p>Also:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; configured the network, fixed the computer name (mispelled), made dslog user, exchanged keys so that atguru could do the backup, checked all the data serial ports to confirm data was coming in (except knudsen and em122).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been running on it for over a week now.&nbsp; I think it is set.&nbsp; Input 7 is still doing the Lyle cruise thing from the 3.5 right now.</p>
