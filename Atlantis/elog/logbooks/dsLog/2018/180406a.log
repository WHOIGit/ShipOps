========================================
<p>Atdatalog unexpectedly shut down on 03 April 18. Rebooted and all back to normal.</p>

<p>Discovered a couple days later custom cruise track on ship&#39;s website was not working. Traced it to the /underway/proc/AT1804**.dat files were empty since the shutdown. Found a file /underway/proc/make_data.lock from the shutdown time.</p>

<p>Deleted the .lock file and .dats resumed producing data and underway track resumed plotting.</p>
