font-family:Arial">The previous group (KT Scott and Julianna Woo) had problems with the scintillation counter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were using the smaller (7 mL) vials.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The system was giving errors and would stop counting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the samples would be left in the detector (or somewhere inside the system) and special action would have to be taken to get the sample to drop out (can stop the regular software and run the Commfiler software and direct it to recover a vial).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It did this continually, causing them to have to babysit the counter to get their vials counted.</span></p>
