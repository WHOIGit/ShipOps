========================================

<p><span style="font-size: large;">This is a log recording the checks done on the isovan during the at37-02 cruise.&nbsp; KT Scott had isotopes delivered at WHOI that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">need to be refrigerated.&nbsp; We are in very hot weather, and the original reefer in the van does not stay cold enough.&nbsp; Her isotopes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">are in the small black refrigerator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">10/1/2016 - reefer still cool, Mr. slim still working - sprayed compressor with fresh water and tested<br />

<p><span style="font-size: large;">8/28/2016 - checked - van temperature okay (set to 26 degrees C to keep it cooler than surroundings but not cold)</span></p>
