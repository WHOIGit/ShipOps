========================================
<p>Description of Problem:&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the scientist is experiencing problems with the scintillation counter - vials getting stuck, not getting back to try.&nbsp; She has been having to end her counting and play with the software until it kicks out her vial into the drawer.&nbsp; She did not know where the vial was hanging up.&nbsp; It appeared to her that the bottle might not have been properly aligning with the tray and therefore, could not be placed back in the tray.&nbsp; She was using the 8 x 12 tray.&nbsp; The problem did not occur at the same location every time.</p>
<p>Steps to diagnose:&nbsp; I made up a tray of 10 small vials, placing them in positions A1,A7, A12, D1, D6, D7, D12, H1, H7, H12.&nbsp; I programmed the software for counting only those locations and made the count time only 10 seconds.&nbsp; I ran a count.&nbsp; Sure enough, on the first tray I got an error when the program was working on H7. The error log is attached below.&nbsp; The error was something about &quot;collision detected&quot; (Juliana had mentioned similar errors) - there is a screen shot on the scintillation counter computer (forgot to bring it down with me).&nbsp; I played with the software a bit, and it kicked out a vial, but I was still one short.</p>
<p>I opted to open up the counter.&nbsp; I loaded the HIDEX Commfiler CSV software and used it to &quot;OMIT&quot; the PMT detectors before removing the lid and opening the shutter (page 84 in service manual).&nbsp; I then removed the lid.&nbsp; Looking down into the counter, I found an undersized sample vial on the bottom of the under main mechanics).&nbsp; This brings up a side bar:</p>
<p><cite>*During the November NAAMES Cruise a scientist came to me asking for long thin tweezers.&nbsp; Upon questioning her, I discovered that she was trying to remove a vial that was stuck in the scintillation counter detector.&nbsp; The sample was supposedly an undersized vial that was inside one of the small vials.&nbsp; The lid had come off of the small vial, so the mechanism could no longer grab it.&nbsp; They (the scientist, and her husband - who was not authorized to be in the isotope van) had already opened the counter and forced open the shutter without taking any necessary precautions.&nbsp; I ended up getting the vial out with a piece of monkey dung on a long screwdriver, and the counter worked for the rest of their cruise, and apparently for the May cruise too (at least we had no reports of issues).&nbsp; However, this problem could be a consequence of those actions.</cite></p>
<p>At any rate, I did a visual inspection of the system and ran through&nbsp; (starting on page 32 of the service manual).&nbsp; I did not make any &quot;adjustments&quot;, but I stepped through all the movement operations using the Commfiler CSV software.&nbsp; Items checked:&nbsp; X-movement, Y-movement, Z-movement, shutter open and close, location of home position, picking up vial and depositing in detector, retrieve vial from detector and put back in tray.&nbsp; I visually inspected the springs inside the detector and testing them by pushing on them with a wood stick.&nbsp; I cleaned the suction apparatus with alcohol, and cleaned some corrosion off the tray with a metal brush.&nbsp; Everything seemed to be in working order.&nbsp; I closed the system back up and an another tray of 10 vials is positionsA7, B2, B11, D5, D8, E6, G2, G11, H1, H7.&nbsp; This time, everything worked fine.</p>
<p>I have asked the present scientist to come and get me if and when it happens again so I can come up and open the system and watch the vial retrieval process.&nbsp; I suspect that either the mechanism was a little out of wack due to abuse and maybe running it through it's courses will have helped, or, we may need to make an adjustment to the suction mechanism.&nbsp; I do not believe there are any misalignment issues at this point.</p>
