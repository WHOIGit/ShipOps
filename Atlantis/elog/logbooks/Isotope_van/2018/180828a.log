<p>Hi David &ndash; Please disregard the previous e-mail in place of this one. Thanks! I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you may be aware, earlier this year we had an NRC inspection. We did not have any violations or findings as a result of this<br />
inspection, however it did prompt Ron and I to look into the documentation process of the close-out swipe reports that the scientist<br />
aboard the vessels should be conducting and also the training profiles of the SSSG techs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. We&rsquo;d like to work with the SSSG tech&rsquo;s in a collaborative effort to make sure these close out swipe reports are being completed<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; by the scientists and that they make their way back to EH&amp;S for recordkeeping on our end. I will be making sure to communicate<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; this expectation to both WHOI and Non-WHOI scientists during the authorization process but I was hoping you could also pass along<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; the word to the SSSG techs to help remind the scientists while aboard the vessel and ensure the results get back to EH&amp;S. Could<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; you work with the techs to help facilitate this process where the close out swipe reports are completed and results sent to EH&amp;S?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; E-mailing them to myself or Ron would be fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. In regards to training, I believe the current RAM safety trainings that the SSSG should be taking is Radiation Safety Training<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; and Low Level Radioactive Waste Training. We may also have an additional training we might want to look into adding or<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; incorporating into the LLRW one but I&rsquo;d like to get your feedback first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. These trainings (Rad Safety &amp; LLRW) are both important for the tech&rsquo;s to stay current on, given that they may have to handle<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; radioactive material and/or have to sign a radioactive waste manifest in a rare situation where the waste is picked up at any<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; location other than WHOI. I just wanted to verify with you that this is the case and the SSSG tech&rsquo;s understand these should be<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; mandatory trainings on their profiles? I don&rsquo;t have a list of people to refer to when checking training status like I would in<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; the case of our shore-side authorizations, so I was hoping you could provide a list of the techs to us so when periodic training<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; checks are conducted by us or during a regulatory inspection, we know who to check?<br />
&nbsp;2. From a recent situation involving the Jack Porter Authorization, we had to facilitate an ad hoc training for Sarah Fuller in<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; order for her to be able to receive a radioactive material shipment in Puerto Rico for the Porter group. It is my understanding<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; that this situation may come up again where someone on the vessel (SSSG Tech) may be required to receive a RAM package in a<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; foreign port and would need to be trained to do so. If you agree that this situation does have the potential to come up moving<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; forward and you feel it would be a tech that might have to receive a RAM package, I could create and wrap a RAM receiving<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; training section into the existing LLRW training since it is already specific to the tech&rsquo;s and I believe they are the only ones<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; at WHOI that take this one. This way it would not add another safety training to their profile, we would be expanding a current<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; one to include RAM receipt procedures. Please let me know your thoughts on this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Dan</p>
