========================================
<p>To address (sort of) the issue of the hatch falling inside on somebody when removing this hatch, I have drilled a hole through a tab on inside of escape hatch and have a small shackle with a small chain leading to an eye bold on ceiling Unistrut.&nbsp; This is not the cure all but it cannot fall all the way down onto someone or on deck like this.&nbsp; Welding on it would be problematic.&nbsp; There is also a 9/16&quot; Speed Wrench to loosen or tighten dawging (dogging) nuts that tension hatch.&nbsp; This is labeled and&nbsp; should NOT be removed.&nbsp; The hatch is dogged tight at present and should be checked prior to use later this year when science uses it.&nbsp; Gaskets were replaced in Fall of 2012.</p>
