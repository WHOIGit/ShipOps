<p><span style="font-size: large;">Our version of the MikroWin software is the latest version and should run fine on a Windows 7 machine is we choose to upgrade the computer in the future.&nbsp; This is still the software that LabLogic supplies with the Hidex 300SL and it is still fully supported.</span></p>

Hi Allison,<br />
<br />
Actually, 4.43 is the latest available version.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the only changes to this software in some<br />
time is to ensure it can run on Windows 7 - this was done in 4.43 so you already have the latest version.<br />
Therefore, you don't need to do anything else - your software will work on operating systems up to Windows<br />
7.<br />

Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
We have Version 4.43<br />
<br />
I suspect that is old.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

&gt; Hi Allison,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; We can make the download available for as long as you need it - before <br />
&gt; we go down that road though, it would be best to check the exact <br />
&gt; version of MikroWin you are currently running.&nbsp; It may well be that <br />
&gt; you have the latest version anyway.&nbsp; Can you open up MikroWin, and go <br />
&gt; to 'Help | About MikroWin' and let me know what version you have?<br />
&gt;<br />

&gt; That would be excellent!&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if you make your availability time<br />
&gt; limited, but I would ask that if the access is going to expire, if at all possible give me at least a<br />
month.&nbsp; I plan to have a shoreside collegue intercede and get it right away, but having a months time will<br />
allow me to get it when we are next at dock if something goes wrong with my plan.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Thank you so much,<br />

&gt;&gt; Hi Allison,<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; It's a 30MB file - I will upload it to our website and make it <br />
&gt;&gt; available to you as a download as it's too big to send by e-mail - <br />
&gt;&gt; I'll send you an e-mail tomorrow with your logon details if that's ok.<br />
&gt;&gt; Once you have the file, you just need to copy it to the computer you <br />
&gt;&gt; are using and double-click it - it will upgrade the software to be <br />
&gt;&gt; compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; You should only need to do this if you <br />
&gt;&gt; have problems with your existing copy of MikroWin on Windows 7.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for the information.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; How do we go about getting the patch, if needed?&nbsp; I am thinking we'd probably like to have it on the<br />
ship, and this always requires some planning (i.e. depending on the size, it may be hard to download while<br />
offshore).&nbsp; Is it possible to get a copy of it?&nbsp; Or do we need to set up a computer, load the present<br />
software, and then connect to download the patch?<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; MikroWin 2000 is still supplied with the 300SL, so it is still <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; supported.&nbsp; The only change that has been made to later releases of <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; MikroWin 2000 is to ensure it is compatible with Windows 7; this is <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; something to bear in mind if you buy a new computer as it may be <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary to run a patch to update your software if you are running <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Windows 7.<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; I work on a Scientific Research ship.&nbsp; Many of the scientists that come onboard use isotopes in theie<br />
research.&nbsp; Therefore, we have a laboratory van that houses a Hidex 300 SL scintillation counter.&nbsp; This<br />
counter has not been used for a while now.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Over the next few weeks I need to get the van in order and the counter functioning properly and<br />
everything up to date.&nbsp; To that end, I am wondering if you can tell me what the present software being used<br />
for this equipment is.&nbsp; I believe we are using the MikroWin Hidex 2000 application.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; The brochure on your website eludes to MikroWin, but does not specify a version.&nbsp; What is the most<br />
recent.&nbsp; Is MikroWin Hidex 2000 still supported?&nbsp; If not, how do we arrange to upgrade the software?&nbsp; I am<br />
assuming such an upgrade would be free, or at least reasonably priced if the older software is no longer<br />
supported - I hope I'm right in that assumption.&nbsp; Also, are there different PC system requirements for any<br />
newer software?<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for your help,<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
