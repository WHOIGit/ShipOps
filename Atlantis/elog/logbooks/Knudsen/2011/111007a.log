Subject / Summary: Head Tank for 3.5

========================================
<p>&gt; PS - I am also wondering about the reason for the head tank for the 3.5<br />
&gt; transducer array.&nbsp; Initially, I was thinking of the Johnson ships, and the<br />
&gt; transducers there were behind a glass or plexiglass covering (not outside<br />
&gt; the ship's hull) so they needed fluid between the transducer and the plate<br />
&gt; covering.&nbsp; Why does the 3.5 need it?<br />
<br />
The 3.5 array is in a tank, so yes, the water, (or other fluid), is needed to<br />
couple it out of the ship.&nbsp; (yes, right through the steel, no problem)&nbsp; The<br />
array on the Atlantis appears to have a screwed on cover, allowing access from<br />
the outside in a drydock.&nbsp; Hopefully it's watertight.&nbsp; (The one on the Knorr is<br />
completely inside, no cover, not sure about the Oceanus.)<br />
<br />
The second reason for the closed well and header tank is to allow the system to<br />
operate at full power.&nbsp; These transducers will cavitate if run at to high a<br />
power while at atmospheric pressure.&nbsp; I don't have that data in front of me,<br />
but it's a lot less than the 833 watts/transducer that the Knudsen can supply. <br />
(12 transducers/10,000 watts)&nbsp; If the transducers are run under pressure, the<br />
can accept much higher power levels without cavitating.&nbsp; I think the proper<br />
pressure is something like 15 psi, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
The source for this is from a book, I think the title is &quot;acoustic systems<br />
handbook&quot;, or something like that.&nbsp; There may be a copy on the boat.&nbsp; The other<br />
source is the data sheet for the transducers.&nbsp; I'll see if I can locate either<br />
of these and get a little more detail.<br />
<br />
