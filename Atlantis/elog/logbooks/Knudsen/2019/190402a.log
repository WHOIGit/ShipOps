========================================
<p>First functionality test of 12 KHz transducer s/n 018 installed Feb 2019 performed San Francisco Bay March 2019. All operational.</p>

<p>First performance test performed April 20019 in &gt;3000m of water.</p>

<p>S/n 018 appears to perform slightly worse than s/n 1057, installed in 2016, under the same power, gain, and processing settings. However for both it appears that gain, power, and processing required for good return signal are much better than the ship&#39;s original transducers.</p>

<p>Comparison attached.</p>

<p>Acceptable 12kHz return signals acheived for both transducers in &gt;3000m of water at Tx power 2, process shift 4, gain 40dB on the Knudsen 3260.</p>

========================================
<p>Impedance of 12kHz transducers s/n 1112, 1057, and 018 tested during drydock Feb 2019.</p>

<p>Plots attached.</p>

<p>Impedance for s/n 1057 (the best performing unit underway) was around 2.7kOhms at its peak near 12kHz.</p>

<p>Impedance for s/n 018 (fully acceptable underway performance) was around 1.8kOhms at its peak near 12kHz. Impedance was higher for this unit (closer to that of s/n 1057) when tested on deck prior to installation.</p>

<p>Impedance for s/n 1112 (functional but poorly performing underway) was around 0.9kOhms at its peak near 12kHz.</p>
