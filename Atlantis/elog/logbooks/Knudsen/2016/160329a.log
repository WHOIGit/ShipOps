========================================
<p>Upon departure from Charleston, SC 28 February 2016, tested performance of new 12kHz transducer s/n 1057 installed Jan 16 2016 (hereby known as &quot;A&quot;) vs. ship's original 12kHz transducer s/n 112 (hereby known as &quot;B&quot;).</p>
<p>Testing performed with both Knudsen 320 B/R and Knudsen 3260.</p>
<p>Initial testing on the 320 B/R performed while swapping between transducer A and transducer B in ~4000m of water, with power=3, gain=255, and processing gain =7. Differences in the performance of the two transducers were subtle, and not great considering the gain/processing gain levels required for both transducers.</p>
<p>Additionally, 3.5 kHz performed well with the 320 B/R, with power, gain, and processing gain all set to reasonable levels for the given depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial testing on the 3260 performed while swapping between transducer A and transducer B in ~4500m of water, with power =3, gain = 58dB, and process shift = 0.&nbsp; Differences between transducers A and B were stark, with transducer A performing remarkably better at like settings than transducer B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the 3.5kHz was not visible at all on the 3260, and could not seem to &quot;dial it in&quot; to get any kind of return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knudsen was re-tested on 29 March 2016 with the 320 B/R in ~5500 m of water, with power =3, gain = 255, and processing gain = 7. 12kHz results were similar to those a month prior, with only subtle differences between transducers A and B. 3.5kHz still operating normally.</p>
<p>Knudsen 3260 retested on 30 March 2015 in ~5500m of water, with power =2, gain=50-60dB, and process shift 0. Once again noticeable differences between transducers A and B, with A performing much better than B at identical settings.</p>
<p>On this date the 3.5kHz appeared to function normally with the 3260, with power =2, gain=60dB, and process shift 0, so not sure what was up a month ago.</p>
<p>Screen shots of all testing attached.</p>
