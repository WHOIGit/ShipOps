========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The GPS feed to the Knudsen 320B/R was not working.&nbsp; There was serial GPS data coming through the feed, but the Com port did not seem to see it.&nbsp; I moved the feed to Com 4 on the deck unit, re-configured the port for GGA and that one worked (Tried Com1 &amp; Com 2 and couldn't get either to work).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Also, the Knudsen PC was moved while I was on break.&nbsp; The network cable was put in incorrectly (it was plugged into the Science net, not the Atlantis net.&nbsp; So, the time sync wasn't working.&nbsp; Basically, I pinged all the way into Discovery Bay before I notices I had no GPS and an incorrect time on the computer.&nbsp; So, that was a totally wasted data collection attempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I am begging my colleagues to please, please, please actually test the systems after any change is made where cabling is unplugged, etc.&nbsp; A job isn't finished until you (me, or other) has verified that the equipment is functioning properly!!! </span></p>
