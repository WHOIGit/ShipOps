========================================
<p>This is confusing - but this is what the email says (not sure what manual gain has to do with new software, unless that is a change in the software):</p>

<p>I wonder if Knudsen has a more recent version of the software for you all to use. When I talked to Darren about</p>

<p>using the newer software, he said <span style="font-size:12px">if using manual gain, to put the gain way down and use the processing shift to<br />
&#39;dial in&#39; the seafloor.</span><br />
<br />
Quote from Knudsen:<br />
<br />
&quot;1) Increase processing shift and use AGC: we typically recommend adjusting the processing shift such that AGC<br />
can reduce the analog gain down to around 40 to 50dB to prevent saturation of the front end and excess noise.<br />
The sample file showed manual gain of 96dB which can cause excessive noise to overwhelm the actual signal;<br />
applying processing shift instead of some of the analog gain helps to pull out more of the signal and less of<br />
the noise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don&#39;t know what to say about the other ducers, not sure that any one knows much about them.<br />
<br />
Did Robbie or David respond? They got them from SEA and they might be able to get the s/n of the on most<br />
recently used.<br />
