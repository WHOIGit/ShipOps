========================================
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Here are some tools that Hilary recommends for chasing down malware/spyware and bots:</span></p>
<p>The newer version of Symantec does a better job blocking the malware than previous versions, but it doesn't remove<br />
it.&nbsp; If you Google malwarebytes there is a free scanner which installs easily and is a good tool to start with.&nbsp; Let it do a<br />
scan then remove everything it detects. This usual does a pretty good job.&nbsp; Depending on the type of malware we use a few<br />
others but depending on the severity you may have to run it in safe mode first.<br />
<br />
Kaspersky.com also has a couple of different programs to help remove stuff too, like TDSSKiller which kills running processes<br />
to help rove them.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more help, but start with Malwarebytes, it is a nice option.</p>

On shore a lot of the P2P software is legit for instance bittorrents. It is nothing I would ever think of using, but you can<br />
download ubuntu ios using a bittorrent. It is supposed to make downloads faster, but it also allows ne'er-do-wells to launch<br />
bad p2p software on your computer..<br />
<br />
Some P2P software, these are legit, but should not be used on the ship...<br />
<br />
limewire<br />
bearshare<br />
soulseek<br />
frostwire<br />
kceasy<br />
imesh<br />
kazaa<br />
strongdc++<br />
Ares<br />
uTorrent<br />
BitTorrent<br />
BitComet<br />
Azureus Vuze<br />
</span><br />
