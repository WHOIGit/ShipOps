========================================
<p>A while back Allison asked me for example scripts for processing multibeam with MB-system.<br />
I gave ger what I had then.<br />
I forward this recent posting?to the MB-system mail list. It has a link with a general<br />
processing flow diagram, which she<br />
and others might find useful.<br />
<br />
SJM<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is &quot;my&quot; workflow with MB-System. This workflow is more suggestion<br />
that a actual workflow that we always perform here at MARUM. This<br />
workflow is focusing only on the processing of the data, and steps<br />
regarding gridding and plotting are omitted here.<br />
<br />
PS: to avoid that my message is blocked by the mailing list server I<br />
placed the file here:<br />
<br />
http://ftp.marum.de/pub/christian/mbsystem_workflow_diagram/MBES%20data%20workflow.png<br />
<br />
The dashed lines have the command and the boxes the output of that.<br />
<br />
Some steps like remove/apply a new SVP or edit the navigation are<br />
optional (so, do them only if you really need). Other steps like running<br />
automatic filters are not recommend for final maps, but for quick (and<br />
dirty) maps are normally ok.<br />
<br />
The cleaning step with mbeditviz AND after mbedit is not mandatory. The<br />
3D editor is normally able to clean the data (on many cases) that the 2D<br />
editor (ping by ping) won't improvement the data if your map resolution<br />
is not very high. For example for ship multibeam data the 3D editor is<br />
normally just fine, but for AUV data we normally use both (3D for fast<br />
cleaning, and 2D for detailed inspection and cleaning).<br />
<br />
The nomenclature with L1, L2 and L3 levels came from a time when I was<br />
processing satellite images (10 years ago). And L1 level would mean data<br />
that you basically don't touch. L2 would be data that you filter<br />
automatically or do light editing of the navigation, but still don't<br />
touch the multibeam data directly. And L3 would be the edited multibeam<br />
data.<br />
<br />
Also, in this workflow I'm not focusing much on sidescan data. So, you<br />
don't see any mention of mbfilter and mbmosaic.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or critics are welcome to improve this diagram.<br />
