========================================
<p>Dave, Here are the specifics of the license for the additional Macs. &nbsp;Eventually I would like to tie the permanent<br />
machines into the server but I foresee improvements coming for that so use them. &nbsp;You will need to download the clients.<br />
&nbsp;Please let me know if you need assistance. &nbsp;I am sorry I couldn't do more, I've been away all week and have not had<br />
great connectivity. &nbsp; Please do me a favor and keep this with your group and use as you all see fit. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is an additional license key I will send separately.<br />
