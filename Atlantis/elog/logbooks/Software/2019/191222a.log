========================================
<p>WHOI updated our Adobe Premier license used on the Main Lab Mac computers for Alvin video editing. Unfortunately, the renewal only came with one email address - smccue@whoi.edu - and the maximum simultaneous logins is limited to 2 machines. This is despite several communications from sssg that included the alvin_premier email addresses and need for renewals to each of these accounts. These emails can be found in &quot;software&quot; in the sssg account.</p>

<p>Communications are currently ongoing with Scott Cramer (scramer@whoi.edu) to make adjustments in the Adobe portal to include these accounts so we can have at least 4 simultaneous logins at any given time.</p>
