Hi Cris,<br />
<br />
&gt; Not sure I completely understand the comment in Etherpad.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Port:<br />
&gt; SSSG - router mode internet connection<br />
&gt; Ship - router mode<br />
&gt; Science - BRIDGED mode<br />
&gt; IP Handset - router mode<br />
&gt; ////All connections have an individual IP and are showing connected.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Starboard (currently set up)<br />
&gt; SSSG - router mode internet connection<br />
&gt; Ship - router mode internet connection<br />
&gt; Science - ROUTER mode internet connection<br />
&gt; IP Handset - router mode internet connection<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; to which WLNET said that they see 3 active connections (SSSG,Ship and IPHandset) and say the SIM is restricted to only three connections so they want me to reboot.<br />
&gt; <br />
<br />
I honestly do not think the handset should be assigned a username/pw. I think it is supposed work differently. Each of the other ports get a username and pw, most are<br />
router mode, so more than one person can use it. All 'router' ports connections are NAT'd.<br />
<br />
The Science port on the Port FBB should go directly to the cisco router and it is set to&nbsp; bridgemode so that it has a static IP. This IP should be on the C2900<br />
GigabitEthernet0/2&nbsp; 216.86.248.179. Here we are doing some routing magic by sending it down a tunnel via HSN using BGP. If HSN goes away it will switch automagically to<br />
FBB w/ out loosing the TCP connection. If I have an ssh connection to shore and the satellite changes, I will not loose my ssh connection, it will just become very slow.<br />
When HSN comes back it will automagically swap back.<br />
<br />
It could be that we are no longer using the handset (Mike Gagne never tells us anything), and someone&nbsp; figured we can use the port for internet traffic, but we cannot.<br />
Does the handset work? Is it plugged in?<br />
<br />
These notes from the etherpad have username and pw for the handset port, looks like it was updated April 2014, are there any notes in ELOG?<br />
<br />
thanks, laura<br />

Hi Cris,<br />
<br />
It is a mess. I would reboot and power it off for the 30 minutes as WLNET suggested. Martin (who installed the Ka) did mention<br />
in passing that the 30 minutes really does help reset it totally. I have had to do it.<br />
<br />
I think the username/pw were put in in 2014 when the etherpad was updated. I did the original one in 2013. The Knorr FBB did<br />
not have username/pw and the Oceanus did not either. The username/pw that the atlantis has for the handset are totally<br />
different from the other users:<br />
<br />

User: rd108155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pw = same<br />
<br />
Try turning off on the port for 30 minutes, turn it back on w/ the handset not plugged in and then see if you can surf the net<br />
on each of the ports that at in router mode.<br />
<br />
thanks, laura<br />

========================================
<p>Router mode means the connection will be shared with other users, and the NAT module of the terminal will make the necessary address<br />
translations. Use this mode if one or more computers are connected<br />
using the LAN interface, and the terminal should act as a router.<br />
<br />
Bridge mode is an exclusive connection, with NAT disabled. Use this mode together with a network classification entry that selects a<br />
single computer (see Using the network classification table on page 138). This<br />
mode is not available in the Default network user group.<br />
