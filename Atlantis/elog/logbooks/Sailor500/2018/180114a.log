========================================
<p>The Armstrong was having issues w/ the FBB when they were working up North. From Mike:</p>

<p>&quot;The errors seem to have been caused by traveling in and out of the Americas satellite footprint. As soon as we put the unit in &quot;auto&quot; LES selection, it seemed to<br />
have behaved after that. I&#39;ll go through the system next week to see if there are any real issues but for now, these issues seem to have stopped.&quot;</p>
