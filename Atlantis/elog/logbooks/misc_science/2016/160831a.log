<br />
Here is a sketch of how this system seems to be going together. Some items slipped out of this port stop,<br />
which will make the next more busy.&nbsp; An updated schedule is below.&nbsp; Please keep me up to date with continued<br />
progress.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lane<br />
<br />
<br />
- Chris and Zac have been making good progress with the interface software.&nbsp; They have been working together<br />
to define the interface between their two bodies of code.&nbsp; Chris tells me that he has brought the in-hull GUI<br />
to a good point.&nbsp; Zac has had success in transporting large data packages across the acoustic link.<br />
<br />
- At the moment the plan is to support one modem/moxa and two transducers (ITC-3013 and ME02350) to be<br />
mounted.&nbsp; Changing between omni and directional transducers will be a cabling exercise.&nbsp; In the final<br />
installation the expectation is to include two modems each on a moxa port, so that the transducer selection is<br />
done with a network selection.<br />
<br />
- Sean has been preparing the Atlantis electronics installation.&nbsp; He has a Sentry modem and moxa for the<br />
installation, and expects the two transducer cables soon.&nbsp; He may be able to get the modem/moxa installed in<br />
the next few days, or that may be delayed, along with the transducer cable, to the next port.&nbsp; He expects the<br />
electronics to be removed later this Fall, though the transducer cabling will stay in place.&nbsp; While a couple<br />
of other options were investigated, the Engineering Dry Stores space (near the Octans/Phins) still looks like<br />
the best choice.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: Yellow;">Rod, a single cable outer diameter for the micromodem is 0.4&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp; Sean</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: Yellow;">&nbsp;The plan for the micromodem transducers is to route two underwater cables from the transducer well to two<br />
potential locations.&nbsp; Either the galley's dry stores room or the <span style="background-color: Lime;">engineering stores room </span>which has the phins<br />
located in it.&nbsp; The first location requires&nbsp; going through 1 roxblox and the second location requires going<br />
through 3 roxblox and a small opening into the dry stores that already has a cable going through it.&nbsp; We have<br />
put eyes on the blocks and confirmed there are enough openings in each of the blocks for the two cables.Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: Yellow;">If the topside unit is in galley dry stores, we will connect through a serial cable through a breakout box<br />
that is in the dry stores and connects to the computer lab.&nbsp; If we go next to the phins, we will connect<br />
through ethernet that already exists in the phins location.<br />
Sean<br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: Lime;">Because of the Ethernet connection, my vote goes to the Phins location, even though that means some more<br />
effort in pulling the wires.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lane</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: Yellow;">All,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two micromodem cables have been routed from the phins location in engineering stores back to the<br />
transducer well.&nbsp; The cables are routed appropriately through water tight pass throughs (roxblox) and on the<br />
cable trays under the straps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will plan to mount the topside box and moxa today and double check the cable routing.<br />
<br />
please identify someone to complete the following...<br />
<br />
1) Terminate cables in the transducer well<br />
2) terminate cables in the stores room.<br />
3) Test and configure ethernet cables in stores room to computer lab<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Sean</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: Lime;">Thank you, Sean, for bringing this up. I hope we can identify someone to do this work.&nbsp; I think it is also<br />
worth noting that the transducers are scheduled to get installed on Saturday the 23rd.&nbsp; So this work has to<br />
happen after that occurs, yet before the sail time early on the 28th.&nbsp; It's not a whole lot of time, and<br />
having it done earlier means more opportunity for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lane</span><span style="background-color: Yellow;"><br />

<p>- Rod has been designing the hull transducer installation.&nbsp; He is currently designing for two transducers in<br />
the sea chest, along with a single acoustic baffle that accommodates them both.&nbsp; Sentry is providing an<br />
omni-directional transducer for this installation. Though it is desired to install both transducers, it is not<br />
yet clear if a directional transducer will be installed or not.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: Yellow;">Rod Catanach emai - Just finished diving on it and found it to be flush with the hull and having a plate ~<br />
9-1/2&quot; dia in the middle with 4 bolts on ~ 8&quot; dia BC&nbsp; holding it in.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Sentry has loaned a modem and transducer to the submarine.&nbsp; Keenan is loaning a pressure housing for the<br />
modem.&nbsp; After its pressure test, Keenan will install the modem into the housing.&nbsp; We will have to order<br />
whatever cables Keenan can't loan.<br />
<br />
- After the transducer well design is finished and in fabrication, Rod will concentrate on the submarine mount<br />
for the modem housing and transducer.&nbsp; The current thought is to mount the modem within the sail with the<br />
transducer on top.<br />
<br />
- One computer will be mounted in the Main Lab for display of images and text messages.&nbsp; The expectation is<br />
that the software here will be the same or very similar to the in-hull software.&nbsp; Alvin will likely purchase<br />
this computer, though Jon may have an available display/kb/mouse.<br />
<br />
- One computer will be mounted in the Main Lab for display of navigation data.&nbsp; This will be done with NavG (I<br />
think), which Jon will prepare.&nbsp; Alvin will likely purchase this computer, though Jon may have an available<br />
display/kb/mouse.<br />
<br />
- One computer is already in place in the Computer Lab for display of navigation data, also using NavG.<br />
<br />
- A number of items were not able to be completed during this port stop, which pushes them to the next.<br />
Updated schedule:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; June 30:&nbsp; Have prototype software (GUI, modem transport) available.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 8:&nbsp; Submarine modem mounting and wiring is complete.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 16:&nbsp; Ship arrives.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 18:&nbsp; Transducer installation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 18:&nbsp; Transducer cable run and modem installation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 18:&nbsp; Mount computers in Main Lab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 20:&nbsp; Integration of software onto ship hardware.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 22:&nbsp; Submarine moved onto the ship.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 28:&nbsp; Ship and submarine leave.<br />
