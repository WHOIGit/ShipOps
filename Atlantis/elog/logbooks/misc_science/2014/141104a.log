&nbsp;when you have the cables all plugged in to the deck unit with the female 3 pin microphone jack at the end, pin 1<br />
is the signal and pin 2 is ground. Pin 3 is not used.<br />

&gt; Hi,<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; I am Allison Heater, an SSSG on the Atlantis.&nbsp; Stefan Sievert is out here with an Edgetech Model 8011A Acoustic<br />
&gt; Command Ranging Transciever - S/N 26066 that he has borrowed from you.&nbsp; I am trying to determine/ensure that the<br />
&gt; transducer connector cable is wired compatibly with our transducer.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; I looked the manual Stefan brought, and I don't see a pin out for the transducer connector.&nbsp; Do you have one?<br />
&gt; Do you know if this deck unit has been used before on the Atlantis in conjunction with the Atlantis' 12 kHz<br />
&gt; transducer (if so when).<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; The bold side of me feels these are quite standardized, and that we would have wired our transducer to match the<br />
&gt; standard of the deck units that WHOI uses.&nbsp; However, the ultra-conservative side (the one that does not want to<br />
&gt; replace a transducer mounted on the hull) needs reassurance that is the case.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; If you could let us know as soon as possible, it would be a great help!<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Thanks for your help,<br />
