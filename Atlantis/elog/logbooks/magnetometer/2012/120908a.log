========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">During the three days prior to pulling in the magnetometer we had very bad weather (wind gusts up to 50 knots, large waves, and rain, etc).&nbsp; For the last 48 hours, </span><span style="font-size: large;">the data were very spikey. and frequently the maggie was going into &quot;auto-tune mode&quot;</span><span style="font-size: large;"> .&nbsp; So frequently, that we eventually turned that off.&nbsp; We decided we needed to pull it in for a look, science decided that we may as well pull it in completely, as they had basically what they needed anyway.&nbsp; Upon pulling it in it was discovered that the fish had been spinning (we don't know for how long, it had been out for more than 3 weeks, but I suspect it started spinning at some point after the weather got bad - I think the conductors would have completely severed had it been doing that the entire time).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I spent about 4 hours out on deck getting out as much of the twist as I could.&nbsp; The science objectives did not allow us the time to stream it behind the ship again.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">After untwirling, I megged the cable.&nbsp; Results:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Insulation Resistance: Ohms = 6.85 GOhms DAR=1.02 PI=0.84 and uF= 0.046<br />
@ 50 Volts<br />
<br />
Continuity:&nbsp;&nbsp; conductor = 5.03 Ohms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ground = 4.96 Ohms<br />
<br />
*I also looped them, leaving the insulation resistance test side connected up and checked<br />
continuity (just to assure that I had a valid connection for the insulation resistance test)<br />
- it came out to 9.67 Ohms.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size: large;">The cable tested okay.&nbsp; It is hard to say how it will react when put back in the water though.&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The deck cable we were using failed the insulation resistance test (@ 50 Volts) so it is possible that the spikey data at the end of the deployment was caused by that - in other words, I would not consider the winch cable bad just because it looks sort of ugly.</span></p>
