========================================
<p>-Timing: The time sync of BOB seems to suck. The only way we&#39;ve gotten around it is starting new surveys frequently and re-syncing the clock in<br />
conjuction with those. I&#39;ve seen the data go haywire with re-syncing the clock mid-survey.</p>

<p>-Tuning: Have you tried manual tuning?:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With cursor in the BOB terminal window:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Type &quot;0&quot; to stop sampling.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Type &quot;y&quot; to turn auto-tuning off<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Type &quot;L&quot;, followed by a uT value at the prompt that you expect to<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be measuring; i.e &quot;43&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Type &quot;f&quot; to take a single reading to see that the measured values<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have returned to somewhere near normal<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Type &quot;4&quot; to resume sampling at a slow data rate to allow the mag<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to readjust its brain.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -After a couple minutes of sampling with auto-tuning off, type &quot;x&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to re-enable auto-tuning<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -After awhile (20 mins, maybe an hour or two) when the maggie has<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resumed consistent, good sampling, up the rate back to 1Hz.</p>
