========================================
<p>We have been using the SeaSpy Maggie out here on the Atlantis over the last several months - mostly very successfully.&nbsp; Back in November, we ran into some<br />
heavy noise issues, a new deck cable was run, and that mostly solved the problem.<br />
<br />
During this cruise (Pito Deep) we ran into noise issues again (note - both cruises were to areas where the fields are &quot;low level&quot; - I am not sure of the<br />
terminology, but right now I think we are moving from a max that was around 32 uT down to 24 uT byt the time we reach Arica, CHILE).<br />
<br />
We started getting spikes in our data, and the spiking continued to worsen over time.&nbsp; Dave S (other SSSG onboard) discovered that there was an issue with the<br />
splice between the deck cable and the umbilical leading to the towfish.&nbsp; If it was touched/moved the data spikes went wild, suggesting a loose connection in<br />
the splice somewhere.&nbsp; So, I cut the splice out and redid it.&nbsp; At first, everything looked really good, but over the course of a day and half the spiking<br />
returned and again was getting worse.&nbsp; So, I redid the splice a second time.<br />
<br />
The first time I did the splice, I noted that the umbilical shield looked corroded.&nbsp; I cleaned it up before soldering it to the ground, but I did not cut back<br />
further.&nbsp; The second time, I cut back an additional 6-8 inches and noticed the shield looked much better.&nbsp; I cut off the &quot;somewhat corroded looking&quot; portion<br />
before and got to &quot;shinier&quot; shield this time before re-doing the connections.&nbsp; I had high hopes, but when we plugged it all back in, it did look about 85%<br />
better, but far from perfect.<br />
<br />
We ran some tests and also tried to sample at 1 Hz and it looked really bad then (most of this cruise we've used 0.2 Hz).&nbsp; So, that is where we stood up until<br />
the ship encountered fishing gear (around Feb 15) and pulled the maggie in for an hour or so.&nbsp; When it was re-deployed, Dave S. cleaned the connector very well, and the data looked pristine for quite a few hours after that.&nbsp; I even upped the sampling rate to 1 Hz and was only getting minor, isolated spiking.&nbsp; Then Mike Daffron requested some more diagnostics.&nbsp; I ran those and sent the screenshots.&nbsp; When I set the maggie back on regular sampling, it was extremely noisy again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The test was:</p>
<p>You can run this test with the mag deployed and stopped cycling, and it should take about five minutes.&nbsp; To run this test, first stop cycling, then put the SeaSPY in diagnostic mode with the &quot;\&quot; command and confirm with &quot;y ot Y&quot;. Then send the &quot; ^ &quot; command to start the test. It should run a quick noise test and then check each of the capacitor banks from 0 - 8 if it passes the noise test.</p>
<p>Over the past several days, the maggie has definitely exhibited noisier data during the day time than at night.&nbsp; I am thinking that ship noise may be affecting the data (more going on during the day - grinding, needle gunning, etc).</p>
