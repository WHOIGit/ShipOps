========================================
<p>Fount no output from fluorometer.&nbsp; Upon inspection, found terminals of Metrabyte were corroded.&nbsp; Cleaned and tightened terminals, now working OK.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Metrabyte clearly had (salt?) water spilled on it at some point, although there is no obvious source.&nbsp; </p>
