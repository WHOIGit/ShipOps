========================================
<p>I cleaned the tubing for our instrumentation hooked to the uncontaminated salt water system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstalled by 13:01 GMT 9/24/2011.&nbsp; It was down for about an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED ON 9/22/2011 - that is when it started to look bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
