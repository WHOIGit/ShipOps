========================================
<p>9-Nov-2011 14:50Z to 9-Nov-2011 16:09Z&nbsp; turned off flow thru SBE pump and shut valves to clean fluorometer and tubing - thermosalinograph &amp; fluorometer data bad during this period</p>
<p>NOTES ABOUT CLEANING:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; If em122 is running, need to set the sea surface sound velocity to &quot;MANUAL&quot; and enter the latest value</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Be very careful of fluorometer fittings - don't twist or bend.&nbsp; The one on the left side is a repair job (another repaired fitting in allison's desk drawer)</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; should let samos and noaa know about data bad during cleaning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
