========================================
<p>Installed S/N 4537678-0122 Thermosalinograph.&nbsp; The calibration values were entered into Calliope's metadata.&nbsp; They do not need to be entered anywhere else in Calliope.&nbsp; I confirmed this by hyperterm to COM9 at 9600 baud and typing &quot;DC&quot; which displayed the calibration values and confirmed that they are stored within the instrument.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">8/23/2012 22:15-22:30 GMT - cleaned fluormeter - I quickly replumbed the thermosalinograph so it would continue to output data and then cleaned the fluorometer (values were drifting upward)</span></p>
