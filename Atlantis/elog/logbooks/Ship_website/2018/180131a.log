========================================
<p>The default font size for the axis on the data plots (gnuplot plots) was too large and unreadable.&nbsp; I created a variable in get_data.pl called font1 - this is the font size.&nbsp; As of 2018-Jan-31 the line in get_data.pl reads (right now it is on line 118 of get_data.pl):</p>

<p>$font1 = 9;</p>

<p>I added a line in each of the plot scripts (atmp, depth, etc.):</p>

<p>set tics font &quot;,$font1&quot;</p>

<p>This sets both the x and y axis to the font size designated in get_data.pl</p>

<p>At font size &quot;9&quot; right now everything is legible</p>
