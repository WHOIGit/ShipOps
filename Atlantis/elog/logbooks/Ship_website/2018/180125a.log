========================================
<p><span style="font-size:16px">During the summer of 2017, Laura made a new directory /var/www/html/network where she put in copies of the current hosts tables.&nbsp; We were using /var/www/html/sssg/hosts before.&nbsp; I changed the links so all point to /var/www/html/network. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">When we are making changes to any hosts tables, copy the new tables to /var/www/html/network.</span></p>
