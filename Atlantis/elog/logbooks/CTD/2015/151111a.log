========================================
<p>Fluorometer channel bulkhead connector replaced for corrosion/bent pin 23 Aug 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear of the problem.<br />
Clearly you had seawater in the AG206 connector based on your description.<br />
1. Do you have another cable (ag206f to mcil6f) for the combined fluorometer-turbidity sensor?<br />
Be sure it is for FLNTURTD.<br />
2. Are you sure FLNTURTD is properly set up? Do you have the test cable to check? And are you<br />
aware of the diet coke range test? It's on the WETLabs site (not kidding about that.)<br />
3. Can you confirm you have the replacement AG306 bulkhead and o-ring in your spares? This can<br />
be done on the field.<br />
4. I can send replacement eco-fl unit to agent, but can someone hand carry the sensor? Please<br />
ask around.<br />
5. I'm away from Tuesday afternoon Aug 25 until mid November on NB Palmer trip. Needed the<br />
funding. Until Dave Wellwood returns Sept 4, Jason Smith, copied here, is the contact.<br />
Copy Dave, Jason and me on correspondence please.<br />

&gt; Hi Marshall,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &nbsp; We've been having sporatic problems with the Fluorometer.&nbsp; It has been working part of the<br />
time, and then shutting off.&nbsp; We've changed out cables and it still is intermittent.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &nbsp; While changing cables, we found a bent pin with corrosion at its base on the bulkhead<br />
connector of the SBE9.&nbsp; The pin broke when we tried to straighten it.&nbsp; We dummied that port<br />
off, and switched things around to use another port.&nbsp; We still have the problem.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &nbsp; We just did our last cable swap.&nbsp; The problem is still there.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &nbsp; Would it be possible to ship us a different fluorometer?&nbsp; I guess we should have brought<br />
one with us.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &nbsp; I'd also like your opinion about replacing the bulkhead connector out here?&nbsp; We have time,<br />
and it doesn't seem hard to do.&nbsp; I just worry about possibly having problems with the Craig<br />
Lee cruise next.&nbsp; I'll look around and see if we have o-rings for the work.</p>
