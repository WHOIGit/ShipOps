========================================
<p>IN ADDITION TO THE PROGRAMMING ISSUE - ANOTHER ISSUE AROSE - so see clear to bottom for email from vendor</p>
<p>*****HERE's MARSHALL'S</p>
<p>MAY 15 - FLTURTD STOPPED COLLECTING DATA AFTER 1200 OBSERVATIONS</p>
<p>The fluorometer ECO 1012 used on AT27 was found to have an internal parameter set to deliver 1200<br />
observations at 1Hz, which limited analog and digital output to 20 minutes duration. After that time the<br />
unit shuts down and output analog voltage stays at the last output voltage slowly decaying until power is<br />
reapplied.<br />
<br />
It is not known how this parameter was set. It is a feature used for moored applications. This parameter can<br />
only be changed by using the digital interface test cable.<br />
<br />
I had to dig into the manual and discuss with WETLabs until the symptoms made sense. It works fine with the<br />
parameters set to continuous output.<br />
<br />
This parameter was changed some time prior to 2014 calibration. By whom and exactly when we may never know<br />
but it is unlikely to have changed by itself spontaneously.&nbsp; Last night I confirmed with WETLabs that the<br />
unit arrived at WETLabs in 2014 with this feature set, was calibrated by them,&nbsp; the feature kept active when<br />
delivered back&nbsp; to WHOI. Having never used this feature it never occurred to me to see if it was activated.<br />
<br />
I am doing two things immediately to prevent a recurrence:<br />
<br />
1. Check each of the WETLabs fluorometers and transmissometers for the digital settings to assure we know<br />
their present configuration and that it is correct for our use,<br />
<br />
2. Provide Atlantis SSSG with the test cable and copy of documentation for the instruments to enable SSSG to<br />
do this check on their own.<br />

<p>MAY 14 - &quot;FL window&quot;</p>
<p>In talking tonight with Dave Stahlke at WETLabs, I had corroborated what we have observed, that the output<br />
of the WETLabs fluorometer may be affected by items near, but not in-line, with the face of the fluorometer.<br />
<br />
Specifically, while the expected sensed volume is about a cubic centimeter centered in between the two<br />
optical windows of an FLNTURTD head, if a reflective or fluorescent object is adjacent to the face, there<br />
may be a measurable offset.<br />
<br />
If you've ever used the fluorescing stick provided by WETLabs, bleached paper, or even your fingernails to<br />
check the output, you likely have seen how these can be sensed in air many centimeters away from the face.<br />
<br />
When in the water, where particles cause multiple reflections, this effect is more pronounced, and we must<br />
take care to reduce it however possible.<br />
<br />
For example, depending on the fluorometer orientation, the white painted housing of a SBE9 pressure case may<br />
reflect the light beam output of the fluorometer, where it can be redirected into the sensor by reflective<br />
particles in the sensed volume.<br />
<br />
For this reason, Dave recommends orienting the FL-series fluorometers such that the light beam is pointing<br />
furthest away from any object near the face. When mounted onto the SBE9 body with the Sea-Bird mounting kit,<br />
this means that the oval optical window with the blue and clear LEDs inside should be closest to the SBE9<br />
body, and thus pointing away from the body, to minimize the likelihood of light energy taking multiple<br />
reflective paths back to the sensor.<br />
<br />
While the effect is small, it can result in measurable change to the output.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm marking the plastic side of the WHOI ECO-series housings which come in my lab with an engraved and<br />
painted line to indicate the side opposite the light beam. This will help us assure that the ECO<br />
fluorometers are oriented to keep the beam away from objects which may cause sensing errors.<br />
<br />
I'll be passing along more info about suggested test and verification procedures on the WETLabs ECO and<br />
C-star sensors in the next few days. These come from the WETLabs site and Sea-Bird Application notes.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or concerns, contact me or Dave Stahlke at WETLabs (541-929-5650 ext 215).<br />

<p>*******HERE IS ONE ABOUT A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM (SAME SYMPTOMS)&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian Walsh &lt;ian@wetlabs.com&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howdy Marshall, and all the ships at sea<br />
Oh boy, can't wait!<br />
Clarification: the 695 signal is the fluorescence due to chlorophyll.<br />
The 700 signal is the backscattering signal.<br />
<br />
So, at 1200 samples that channel is saturating.<br />
<br />
This is a new failure mode to me, but probably one that is easy to figure out what the problem is.<br />
<br />
If you haven't sent it back to us, we should be able to do a remote diagnosis.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Marshall,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope you're having a grand time on your cruise.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We've got a few minutes so I thought I'd let you know what we found with flurometer #1012.&nbsp; As you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably know, it gives data for 2 wavelengths, 695nm and 700nm.&nbsp; Well, at 1200 samples, the 700nm data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stream sticks at 4119.&nbsp; The 695 data stream continues to respond as expected.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Truly strange.&nbsp; We'll figure it out somehow, but I thought you'd get a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, and the flurometer is set up correctly.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aloha,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ds<br />
