========================================
<p>http://fortecarbon.com/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [fortecarbon.com] &nbsp;&nbsp; - this is the one that Chris Griner got our long poles from (he got a deal because they'd been returned by someone - I attached Chris' invoice)</p>
<p>http://www.clearwatercomposites.com/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearwater Composites - this is the name of the company that Justin Fujii gave me - Sentry has ordered some poles through them</p>
