========================================
<p>In talking tonight with Dave Stahlke at WETLabs, I had corroborated what we have observed, that the<br />
output of the WETLabs fluorometer may be affected by items near, but not in-line, with the face of the<br />
fluorometer.<br />
<br />
Specifically, while the expected sensed volume is about a cubic centimeter centered in between the two<br />
optical windows of an FLNTURTD head, if a reflective or fluorescent object is adjacent to the face,<br />
there may be a measurable offset.<br />
<br />
If you've ever used the fluorescing stick provided by WETLabs, bleached paper, or even your<br />
fingernails to check the output, you likely have seen how these can be sensed in air many centimeters<br />
away from the face.<br />
<br />
When in the water, where particles cause multiple reflections, this effect is more pronounced, and we<br />
must take care to reduce it however possible.<br />
<br />
For example, depending on the fluorometer orientation, the white painted housing of a SBE9 pressure<br />
case may reflect the light beam output of the fluorometer, where it can be redirected into the sensor<br />
by reflective particles in the sensed volume.<br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">For this reason, Dave recommends orienting the FL-series fluorometers such that the light beam is<br />
pointing furthest away from any object near the face. When mounted onto the SBE9 body with the<br />
Sea-Bird mounting kit, this means that the oval optical window with the blue and clear LEDs inside<br />
should be closest to the SBE9 body, and thus pointing away from the body, to minimize the likelihood<br />
of light energy taking multiple reflective paths back to the sensor.<br />
</span><br />
While the effect is small, it can result in measurable change to the output.<br />
<br />
I'm marking the plastic side of the WHOI ECO-series housings which come in my lab with an engraved and<br />
painted line to indicate the side opposite the light beam. This will help us assure that the ECO<br />
fluorometers are oriented to keep the beam away from objects which may cause sensing errors.<br />
<br />
I'll be passing along more info about suggested test and verification procedures on the WETLabs ECO<br />
and C-star sensors in the next few days. These come from the WETLabs site and Sea-Bird Application<br />
notes.<br />
<br />
