========================================
<p>Mid-cruise on AT41 SBE3 1714, installed as the primary temp sensor, started drifting off the secondary temp sensor, up to ~0.25 degrees. Swapped in spare 5161 and primary and secondary agreed again. Sent in for service. Wellwood brought 4328 as the new spare 6 Sept 18.</p>
