========================================
<p>On casts 002 &amp; 003 of AT42-22, SBE43 s/n 0449 showed problems with flatlining in the upper ~100m. Marshall suspects the membrane gone bad.</p>

<p>Mid-cruise replaced on package with s/n 0723. Worked fine for remaining casts of cruise.</p>

<p>0449 sent back to WHOI Feb 2020, 0444 sent to Gulfport as new spare.</p>
