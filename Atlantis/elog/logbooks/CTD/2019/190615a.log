========================================
<p>Due to problems during at42-11 (actually 1 cast in at42-10, but not identified as issue until at42-11), Marshall sent us a new SBE9plus for our CTD&nbsp;&nbsp; (problem possibly eminating from SBE9P-0749;&nbsp; Marshall sent new:&nbsp; SBE9P-0462).&nbsp; The CTD came from the Alucia (last used).&nbsp; We put our presently mounted sensors from SBE9P-0749.&nbsp; The 9Plus was set up and put into active use during leg 2 of at42-12.&nbsp; While setting up the new 9P it was discovered that two of teh bulkhead connectors were corroded and necked in some near the bulkhead (temp 1 &amp; cond 2)</p>

<p>PROBLEM (THAT MIGHT BE 9P-0749):&nbsp;&nbsp; see other elog entry&nbsp; - message id #55</p>
