========================================
<p>The IEEE-488/RS-232C connector on the deck unit is for the data cable.&nbsp; Right now that is going to COM2 on the CTD computer.&nbsp; The internal switches are also set to 19200 baud.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The modem channel connector on the deck unit is for the underwater carousel unit.&nbsp; Right now, it is going to COM1 on the CTD computer.&nbsp; The baud rate is 300 (but is not configurable).&nbsp; COM1 is the one right next to the video connector.</p>
<p>To check COM ports, can use seaterm - hit the deck unit reset switch.&nbsp; If COM1 has the data cable connected at the correct baud rate some useful configuration data will be displayed on the screen (see section 3-2 of teh SBE 11plus Deck Unit manual).</p>
