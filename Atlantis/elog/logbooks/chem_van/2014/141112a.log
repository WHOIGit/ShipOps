========================================
<p>There was water discovered on the floor of the acid side of the chemvan&nbsp; on 2014-Nov-10.&nbsp; There had been a very intense rain storm.&nbsp; So, possibly the water came from that.&nbsp; The liquid was tested with litmus paper prior to determining it was not a result of a chemical spill.&nbsp; The water was drained out.&nbsp; However, the net day there was more (it did rain overnight, but not very much)</p>
