========================================
<p><u>Exhaust Fan Maintenance:</u></p>

<p>The exhaust van cover only had 1 out of 3 hex head screws still in place and so was vibrating intensely when the fan was running. New hex head screws were purchased and are being stored in the SSSG Office&nbsp;in the #07&nbsp; hardware drawer and are labeled.</p>

<p>Also in the container are replacement hex head screws for the exhaust trunk panels. Some have already been replaced as they were badly corroded.</p>

<p><u>Light Bulbs:</u></p>

<p>The outboard light on the Base&nbsp;side and inboard light on the Acid&nbsp;side were both out. The engineers have spare bulbs that are specifically rated for enclosed light fixtures. If any bulbs go out again, check in with the engineer on duty to get a new bulb. To gain access to the bulb, simply loosen the single retaining bolt above the bottom assembly&nbsp;and that should allow you to unscrew the entire bottom assembly off&nbsp; (cage &amp; glass globe - not the long stem). I had to spray a little WD40 on the threads.</p>
