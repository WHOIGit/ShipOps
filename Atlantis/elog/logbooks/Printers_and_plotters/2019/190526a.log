========================================
<p>The HP LaserJet 4M machine that had previously been in the Main Lab and then in the Chief Scientist cabin (199.92.161.44 atpr4) was officially retired due to a multitude of non-working parts that we do not have replacements for. The working and useful components were salvaged and placed with other repair parts&nbsp;down on the Tank Top Level with our other printer parts and ink.</p>

<p><u>Components saved from atpr4 for use in atpr3 if needed:</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>power supply</li>
	<li>fuser assembly (+ 2 mounting screws)</li>
	<li>control panel and control overlay</li>
	<li>exhaust fan (with cable and RFI shield)</li>
	<li>transfer roller</li>
</ul>
