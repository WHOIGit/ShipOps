<p>GET DRIVERS AND LOAD THEM ONTO A COMPUTER AND SHARE:</p>
<p>&nbsp; We've experienced great fun(stration) getting folks with new winders 7 machines connected to our printers.&nbsp; Yes,<br />
I know, we could spend a bunch of money buying new printers, but we've become very fond of these old workhorses we<br />
have.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The problem is that most installations of w7 don't have the right drivers, so you have to try to get a good<br />
enough connection through FBB to do w7 printers updates ... or be plugged into WHOI's dock or some other fast<br />
network connection.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The easy fix would be to download the right driver from the printer manufacturer, which can't always be done.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Our work around is this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; First you have to have the right drivers on one machine.&nbsp; You can do that by taking your laptop to a cyber cafe,<br />
or some such place.&nbsp; Fake your computer into thinking you are trying to install whatever printer you need, then<br />
you can do the w7 printer updates.&nbsp; (There is a part in printer installation where the computer wants to query the<br />
printer ... don't let it do that.&nbsp; Do a manual printer selection instead.&nbsp; That should let you do the printer<br />
updates)&nbsp; Then share that printer.&nbsp; When you share it, you will be asked whether you want to load extra drivers,<br />
like 32 bit or 64 bit drivers.&nbsp; Heck, load them all up.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Once you have done that for all the printers on the boat, head back for the fun part.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; With your laptop on whatever network has the w7 computer that needs to connect to the printers (aka new<br />
computer), and the printers being shared on your machine, you can now share the printer with the new machine.<br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">LOAD ONTO INDIVIDUAL COMPUTERS:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
&nbsp; On the new machine, click on start.&nbsp; At the bottom of the menus, there is a box for searching. Put:<br />
\\(name or ip address of the computer sharing the printer).&nbsp; It may be just as easy to browse the network until you find it.&nbsp; Here on the ship, Mikey is a windows 7 machine and it has the drivers for the HP Laser Jet 4M Plus and the HP Color Laser 4550.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; That should show the printers on &quot;sharing&quot; computer.&nbsp; Right click on the printer you want, and select &quot;connect&quot;.<br />
That will load the right driver onto the new machine, and connect to your laptop for printing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; After you have done that for each printer, on the new computer, go back and remove the printers you just<br />
installed (your goal was just to get the driver copied over onto your computer).&nbsp; That will prevent you from having to have your laptop on the network for the new computer to print.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Then you can install the printers in the usual manner on the new machine.&nbsp; The new printer drivers, loaded from<br />
your laptop, should still be on the new computer.<br />
