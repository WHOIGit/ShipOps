========================================
<p>&gt; When we have had computers doing bad things on the network in the past we have taken the computer off the network, if we only have an IP address<br />
&gt; and not really sure who it belongs to &nbsp;we poison it in DHCP and block in<br />
&gt; ftp&#39;s firewall rules. This actually works really well because the scientist will come looking for you to see why they no longer have network<br />
&gt; access.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; dhcpd.conf<br />
&gt; ## deny dhcp to a bad internet user<br />
&gt; #host badmac {<br />
&gt; # &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hardware ethernet 58:b0:35:5c:da:78;<br />
&gt; # &nbsp; &nbsp; deny booting;}<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; and ftp iptables:<br />
&gt; # POISON - do not allow internet access even with cyberoam login. # -A FORWARD -s 10.100.100.47 -j DROP<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
