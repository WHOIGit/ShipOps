========================================
<p>Had some trouble getting the TempusIC laptop (fancy hospital laptop) to accept a manual ip address.&nbsp; So, Laura added a dhcp ip reservation to /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf&nbsp; :</p>

<p>## Hospital fancy diagnostic laptop<br />
host TempusIC {<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; hardware ethernet 00:10:7a:57:0a:1a;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; fixed-address 192.168.11.11;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; option domain-name &quot;science.atlantis.whoi.edu&quot;;<br />
}<br />
It was also added to the hosts.science table and to the cyberoam as a clientless user.</p>

<p>PJ and I tested it, and it was able to hook up to the Wifi directly.&nbsp; In the TempusIC dhcp is left set to &quot;ON&quot;</p>
