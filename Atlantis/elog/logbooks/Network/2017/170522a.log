========================================
<p>Currently sssgnet Moxa 199.92.161.191 which distributes GPS, Gyro, etc data and&nbsp; ftp uses to relay was in iptables as an allowed udp ip address, but the Moxa 199.92.161.192 which does the same for depth, speedlog, etc was not. Science needed a UDP broadcast of current depth, and the relay of it on ftp would not work without adding 199.92.161.192 to iptables.</p>
