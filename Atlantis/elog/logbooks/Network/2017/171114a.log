========================================
<p>FROM EMAIL - Laura Stolp &amp; Eric Bates:</p>

<p>Both ship&#39;s HSN tunnels come into WHOI and land on a 10Mb port, which is really to slow (even for satellite) if both ships are doing telepresence.<br />
Eric Bates is going to swap in a 100Mb port and switch the ships&#39; HSN traffic over tomorrow morning between 0715 and 0730 give or take. HSN will be<br />
down for the length of time it takes Eric to sprint down a couple of doors :).</p>
