========================================
<p>Installed a second cyberoam, this one has the lisence for Application, Web filters and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System). There are 2 ethernet bridges (Science and Ship). Alvin is not on it, they (Bruce and Tony) don&#39;t want the ALVIN network on the internet.&nbsp; Attached my notes as a docx, but the original one lives on google:</p>
