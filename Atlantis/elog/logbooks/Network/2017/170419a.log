Subject: New Script to Extract Sci Names For Cyberoam
Cruise: at37-11
Attachment: 
Encoding: HTML
========================================
<p>I wrote a script called <strong>cyber_science_creator_ds.pl</strong> that will create a file of science names for cyberoam entry.&nbsp; It starts reads from sci1 to the end of the used sci numbers.&nbsp; It also puts the sci number as the password.&nbsp; It does not require editing like the old script.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be good to rename the script and drop the ds part.&nbsp; I just put it in to make the name stand out for easy use.</p>
