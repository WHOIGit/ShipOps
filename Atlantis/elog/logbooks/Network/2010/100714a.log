========================================
<p>&nbsp; For some time now, connections to NS5 from anywhere except the office, have been sluggish.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The problem was in the Ship Network 24 port switch.&nbsp; When all the connections to the switch were moved to locations on the left of the switch, the problems went away.&nbsp; Apparently, part of the switch is going bad.&nbsp; (power-cycling the switch did not help)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; We're going to continue using this switch until it gives more trouble.&nbsp; There are only a few connections to this switch, and they can be handled by an external 16 port portable Netgear switch if needed (this has been tested.&nbsp; Changing one of these switches requires major network interruption.&nbsp; Not the best thing to do during a cruise.</p>
