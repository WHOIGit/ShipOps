========================================
<p>When plugging in a shore connection (i.e. at Scripps), a wan1 priority outbound policy rule should be added as in the attached image.</p>

<p>If striker is rejecting mail due to the ship&#39;s unknown ipaddress, add an outbound policy rule to send traffic from source any to destination 128.128.96.129 via wan2 hiseasnet (see image below).</p>
