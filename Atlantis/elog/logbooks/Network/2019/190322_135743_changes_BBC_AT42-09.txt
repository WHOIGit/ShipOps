NOTES AND IP NUMBERS FROM URI ISC: 
These are the subnets used to support Atlantis/Ealing Connectivity:

Video Equipment aboard Atlantis: 131.128.94.80 /29 ( 131.128.94.81 to 94.94 usable )
131.128.94.81 Atlantis video subnet gateway
131.128.94.82 Altantis transmit 1 (PGM to Ealing)
131.128.94.82 Atlantis transmit 2 (Quad to Ealing)
131.128.94.83 Atlantis receive 1 (Reverse vision from Ealing)

Video Equipment at Ealing: 131.128.94.112 /29 ( 131.128.94.113 to .94.126 usable )
131.128.94.113 Ealing video subnet gateway
131.128.94.114 Ealing receive 1 (PGM from Atlantis)
131.128.94.115 Ealing receive 2 (Quad from Atlantis Ealing)
131.128.94.116 Ealing transmit 1 (Reverse vision to Atlantis)

I am going to request that Verizon makes a DHCP range available at Ealing, so that it???s easy to hook a laptop into that network for configuration purposes. We certainly have enough IP???s to support that.

Video Equipment at URI: 131.128.93.0 /24 ( 131.128.93.1 to .93.254 usable )
131.128.93.1 URI video subnet gateway
131.128.93.90 URI Shore Test Transmitter 
131.128.93.91 URI Shore Test Receiver

The MPLS circuit and router at URI is an existing install from 2017, whereas the Ealing install is new. Our normal startup protocol would be to work like this:
