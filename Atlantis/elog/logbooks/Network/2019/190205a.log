========================================
<p>Both the Chief Science Cabin (port 3422 on patch panel A) and Main Lab VOIP port (1261-A on patch panel B) are temporarily connected to Ship Net for the duration of the shipyard to allow the Port Engineer access (staying in Chief Sci cabin) and for NS5 shipping tracking (Main Lab).</p>

<p>Both cables have a yellow label&nbsp;as a reminder to connect them back to Science Net at the end of the shipyard period.</p>
