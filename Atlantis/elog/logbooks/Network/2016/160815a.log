========================================
<p>I changed this March 2017 to crew and science 100MB in the upload direction, and PIs and such to 200MB in the upload direction. No one ever *purposefully* blows through their upload quota before their download quota, so this will shut off those dropbox and cloud syncs that much faster ;) -Catie</p>
