========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">THis was in reference to the at36 telepresence, but gave some link locations that are valid other times too:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I have cricket plotting the shore router's HSN interface:<br />
http://sssg1.whoi.edu/cgi-bin/cricket/grapher.cgi?target=%2Frouter-interfaces%2Fgigabitethernet0_0;view=Octets<br />
<br />
Regular Shore smokeping plots:<br />
http://sssg1.whoi.edu/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi?target=atlantis_HSN<br />
<br />
These are tcp port 22 smokeping plots:<br />
http://sssg11.whoi.edu/cgi-bin/smokeping.fcgi?target=ATSEA.atlantis<br />
<br />
<br />
There are cricket plots on the ship, but I cannot tell you the clicking :), it is kind of buried, but it is working.<br />
<br />
If the ship cricket plots and the shore (wh-hiseasnet) show the same thing, then the GRE tunnel is not limiting anything,<br />
right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I was watching 443 traffic on ftp:<br />
iftop -i eth2 -f &quot;port 443&quot;<br />
I did see some dropbox and amazonaws traffic, I got kicked off, WHOI was unreachable for about 5 minutes. There seemed to be<br />
quite a bit of traffic.<br />
<br />
As an FYI when we were attempting to do these tests (Telepresence) on the Armstrong, the people that insisted they could not<br />
do anything behind cyberoam were the biggest bandwidth hogs (the chief sci had some program running he could not find, Kevin<br />
Walsh had dropbox running and killed the 2 MB satellite link several times).<br />
</span></p>
<p>AND:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">With lots of help from Art and Eric, I have the shore ebno from hiseasnet plotting on sssg1.whoi.edu.<br />
http://sssg1.whoi.edu/cgi-bin/dygraphs/plot_shore_ebno.pl<br />
<br />
I am not really sure if the dropouts are real or an artifact of wgetting the data.<br />
<br />
There are also smokeping plots that go down the HSN from shore to ship. http://sssg1.whoi.edu/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi<br />
