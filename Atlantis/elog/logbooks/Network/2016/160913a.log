========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">There are scripts on linus for setting up the cyberoam accounts (in sssg's bin)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">cyber_users.pl&nbsp; and cyber_science.pl&nbsp; - they operate on passwd file - copy the passwd file to passwd.txt in the directory you will run the script in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it produces a file like cyber.txt.<cite>abunchofnumbers</cite></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Save that file as a .csv file in a place where you can reach it to import it into cyberoam.&nbsp; In cybero</span><span style="font-size: large;">am open</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">identity and Users and pick &quot;import&quot; to import the file.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">So far, some crew members have just been left in there and you can change the status between &quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">this is good because you don't need to make a file by running the script every time when there is just one crew member arriving.&nbsp; Also, if you delete and re-add the crew members every time, their passwords for cyberoam have to be changed back to something generic.&nbsp; Most crew may have left theirs this way anyway, but if they didn't, their password will go back to username.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">However, it does make it harder to find and activate them all when it is a large changeover.</span></p>
