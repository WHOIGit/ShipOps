Did you update the hosts table and bind? this takes at-hiseasnet out of the host talbes. It needs to be at the top<br />
<br />
at-hiseasnet 128.128.252.1<br />
<br />
I fixed this early in the cruise. It will not work unless this is in the hosts table, so EVERYTIME you update DNS you need to<br />
make sure this line is at the top of ftp:/etc/hosts<br />
<br />
Elog it, or put in part of &quot;this what you need to do to update hosts on the atlantis&quot; doc :).<br />

thanks, laura<br />
