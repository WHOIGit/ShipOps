========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We put the cyberoam back in service today at 1237gmt.&nbsp; There have been a couple of slight hiccups with passwords, and a possible strangeness with dhcp on macs, but otherwise things are fine.&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">What happened to a my macbook and Sonia's macbook, is it was tossed offline.&nbsp; The DHCP connection was taken away.&nbsp; Unplugging and then plugging back in gave an ip for a while, then it got kicked off again.&nbsp; Static IPs solved the problem.&nbsp; We're busy at the moment, but will troubleshoot the problem when we can.<br />
