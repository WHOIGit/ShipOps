========================================
<p>The cyberoam is currently being run in monitor mode. All traffic is passing through its bridged ethernet connection (explained in earlier ELOG). &nbsp;During the port stop I changed a bunch of the firewall rules, and have attached &nbsp;both pre-change and post-change cyberoam configuration and rules. FTP does all the routing and firewalling btw the different networks and ship to shore. The cyberoam box should just allow all traffic between the differentnetworks and shore. The only difference being that the ship network access should not be counted towards a users quota and to do that all traffic to and from all the networks must be allowed before the Live-User traffic rule.&nbsp;All traffic on the science network passes through the cyberoam box (192.168.11.254).. I put a WAN-LAN rule that would allow all traffic from ftp (including all the 4 networks) be allowed to 192.168.11.0/24 through the cyberoambox, this should allow the samba mounts, the UDP broadcasts etc, I then allowed all traffic from the science network to the different ship networks (192.168.11.0/24, 192.168.12.0/24, 192.168.13.0/24,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px;">199.92.161.0/24,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px;">199.92.162.0/24)</span></p>
<p>To turn the captive portal on the last firewall rule needs to be changed from Accept to Deny. This is ID 1, LAN-WAN, #LAN_WAN_AnyTraffic&nbsp;</p>
