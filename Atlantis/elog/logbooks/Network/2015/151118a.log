========================================
<p>Science subnet locked up again ~1000 GMT 18 Nov 2015</p>
<p>Could not ping ftp from science net or vice versa. Could ping within science net computers ok. All other networks to ftp ok.</p>
<p>Cyberroam box was not in line at all, so not a cyberroam problem.</p>
<p>Started unplugging science network one jack at a time, narrowed it down to a computer in the hydrolab, but no way to track which one once the problem stopped.</p>
<p>Nothing in ftp logs/messages to indicate a problem.</p>
