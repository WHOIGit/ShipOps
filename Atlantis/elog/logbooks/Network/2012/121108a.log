========================================
<p>The science nework stopped working through ftp. ran tcpdump</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tcpdump -i eth2 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and got alot of: MPCP Opcode Pause</p>
<p>I looked it up and it seemed to mean that eth2 was getting overwhelmed w/ too much traffic, the buffers were filling up so it stopped passing traffic.&nbsp; The network worked from all other ports. I could surf the network on ftp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried powering down the science switch, but that did not bring eth2 backup on ftp. It could be that I did not wait long enough. I ended up rebooting ftp and it all came back up working. </p>
<p>I am not sure what caused the traffic overload. </p>
