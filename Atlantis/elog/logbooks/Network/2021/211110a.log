========================================
<p>Added an enforced rule in peplink to force all traffic to striker.whoi.edu to go over the Sealink.</p>

<p>Have been seeing issues with ecall completing without finishing the mail transfers:</p>

<p>21/11/10 16:40:41 : Retrieving remote xferout/*tgz files<br />
directory = /usr/local/cmail/incoming<br />
21/11/10 16:40:58 : Removing remote xferout/*tgz files<br />
Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer<br />
21/11/10 16:42:02 : ERROR: Remote rm xferfout/*tgz failed - status = 65280 (255)<br />
21/11/10 16:42:02 : Logging accounting information<br />
21/11/10 16:42:02 : Connect time: 1.8 mins (108 secs).<br />
21/11/10 16:42:02 : ecall completed.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tried setting the enforced route to the FX, the same errors as above persisted. So switched it to the Sealink, issue has disappeared. This will become an issue if/when the Sealink is unplugged from the Peplink for exclusive outreach use, so will need to pay attention to this.</p>
