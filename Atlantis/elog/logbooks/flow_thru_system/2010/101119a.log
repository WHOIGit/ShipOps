========================================
<p>The FSI temperature sensor was set to &quot;inactive&quot; in Calliope some time ago due to a malfunction.&nbsp; However, it was left in place.&nbsp; At around 9:20 GMT 11/19/2010 it began to cause problems for other sensors in the RS485 data loop.&nbsp; First teh BPR data went missing, then corrupt SSCND and FL data began appearing - by 11:05 GMT most of the IMET and UCSW data was missing.&nbsp; The problem was discovered at 13:06 GMT and the UCSW section of the RS485 data loop was isolated (so most of the data returned).&nbsp; The problem was determined to be emanating from the FSI Temperature sensor.&nbsp; This sensor is now unplugged, and the data wires have been disconnected in the j-box in the bow thruster room.</p>
