========================================
<p>On ~03 Oct 2017, the pump supplying the underway sensor loop (5T 2654) was found to have a broken impeller shaft.</p>

<p>It was removed and replaced with the spare CTD pump for the time being.</p>

<p>Marshall noted that we should find a substitute pump designed for continuous duty for our sensor loop.&nbsp;</p>
