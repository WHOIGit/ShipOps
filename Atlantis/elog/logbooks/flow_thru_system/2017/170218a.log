========================================
<p>The flow through has been filling up with enough air to cut the SBE pump off - no flow.&nbsp; It only happens during Jason operations, so it is likely related to the bow thruster. </p>
<p>Anton had rigged a flap on the vent pipe that held the suction (keeping the pipes full to the top where the water comes in and use to go through the FSI sensors).&nbsp; That flap has come off.&nbsp; We need some sort of check valve on that overhead pipe to alleviate this air problem.</p>
