========================================
<p>Installed S/N 4537678-0122 Thermosalinograph.&nbsp; The calibration values were entered into Calliope's metadata.&nbsp; They do not need to be entered anywhere else in Calliope.&nbsp; I confirmed this by hyperterm to COM9 at 9600 baud and typing &quot;DC&quot; which displayed the calibration values and confirmed that they are stored within the instrument.</p>
