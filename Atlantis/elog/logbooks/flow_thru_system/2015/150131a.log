========================================
<p>*IMPORTANT!* DO NOT LEAVE CHLORINATED WATER SITTING IN THE PIPES FOR DAYS! IT IS DESTROYING O-RINGS ON THE PUMP! ALWAYS FLUSH AFTER BLEACHING!</p>
<p>5-4-14: System bleached for several hours in prep for AT34. Catie</p>
<p>4-2-16: System bleached for ~ 1 hour and secured for shipyard. Catie</p>
<p>3-29-17: System bleached for ~1 hour, flushed, secured for Puntarenas inport. Catie</p>
<p>12-8-15: System bleached for 1 hour and secured for shipyard. Catie</p>
<p>5-14-15: System bleached 1/2 day prior to arrival in port for maintenance period. Catie</p>
<p>1-30-15: System bleached and instrument loop tubing removed and cleaned. Catie</p>
<p>12-24-14 System bleached. Catie</p>
<p>12-08-14 Fluorometer cleaned and rough cleaning of tubing. AH</p>
<p>11-14-14 The fluorometer readings were drifting up over the past 3 days.&nbsp; So I cleaned the fluorometer and tubing. 15:10 GMT to 16:20 GMT the flow thru system was out  of service for cleaning - so data values are incorrect during this time. AH</p>
<p>12-2-13 System flushed and bleached. Catie</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">08-23-12 Cleaned the flow thru systems tubing.</span> <span style="font-size: small;">22:15-22:30 GMT - cleaned  fluormeter - I quickly replumbed the thermosalinograph so it would  continue to output data and then cleaned the fluorometer (values were  drifting upward). AH<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">11-9-11 14:50Z to 9-Nov-2011 16:09Z&nbsp; turned off flow thru SBE pump  and shut valves to clean fluorometer and tubing - thermosalinograph  &amp; fluorometer data bad during this period. AH</span></p>
<p>10-23-11 The fluorometer started drifting upward around 21:00Z 10/17/2011.&nbsp; I  noticed it a day or two later (it was still not terrible).&nbsp; This has  been a bad trip for &quot;incidents&quot; (winch level winder pin broke, etc) so  when I went down to the bow thruster room to disconnect the tubing and  experienced the rev'ing of the bow thruster up close and personal, I  decided to wait until after the JASON was out of the water to do this.&nbsp;  Several days went by and the data became very bad and eventually went to  &quot;99999.99&quot;&nbsp; (6:19Z 10/22/2011) which in turn cause caused the latest  data - last 24 hour plots to become messed up (not sure why yet, but the  plots were shifted - example, SWR was plotting as Fluorometer).&nbsp;I finally was able to get down there and clean the fluorometer/tubing  on 10/22/2011 in the afternoon.&nbsp; However, on reinstalling I broke one  of the fluorometer fittings.&nbsp; We do not have another, so I fashioned a  new one out of the threading that broke off, epoxy and a slightly  smaller barbed fitting.&nbsp; I dried the epoxy overnight and reinstalled the  fluorometer - data good 11:17Z 10/23/2011.&nbsp; I need to check the fitting  frequently for a while in order to make sure it is holding up. The thermosalinograph was only down for about an hour on 10/22/2011  while I was cleaning (I replumbed the system overnight so we could use  the thermosalinograph with the em122). AH</p>
<p>09-24-11 I cleaned the tubing for our instrumentation hooked to the  uncontaminated salt water system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstalled by 13:01 GMT  9/24/2011.&nbsp; It was down for about an hour. SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED ON 9/22/2011 - that is when it started to look bad. AH</p>
<p>10-11-10 Fluorometer cleaned 11-Oct-10 - completed at 11:10 GMT.&nbsp; The fluorometer contained growth from going into port (turned off plumbing to flow thru). This was the first opportunity to clean it since the cruise began. AH</p>
<p>06-28-10 Ran some water through the lab UCSW supplies. AH</p>
<p>06-21-10 Ran water through lab taps to flush water through system. AH</p>
<p>06-16-10 A chlorine tablet was added to the strainer when we entered port in San  Francisco.&nbsp; The remainder of tablet was removed as we left the dock  (16-June-2010&nbsp; 1:20 GMT). AH</p>
<p>05-30-10 Removed and cleaned the fluorometer.&nbsp; The voltage values were  creeping upward (30-May-2010).&nbsp; Fluorometer removed from 15:10 GMT to  15:58 GMT.&nbsp; Water flow also cut to thermosalinogrpah during that time  period. Catie</p>
