========================================
<p>I heard there are some issues with the flowmeter on the Tioga. &nbsp;Hoping I can help get to the bottom of it.</p>

<p>It sounds like the flowmeter is consistently producing output messages but that the count is not incrementing. &nbsp;Is that correct?</p>

<p>In your emails you say that you confirmed that the signal was looking good at pin 15 on the Teensy PCB&#39;s connector. &nbsp;That&#39;s good. &nbsp;The hall signal<br />
should then go to pin 13 of the TEENSY itself. &nbsp;Can you check to see that the signal is present there and see if it is at proper voltage levels?<br />
Here is a helpful reference to locate the proper pin:</p>

<p>https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/card7a_rev1.pdf</p>

<p>There should be a 100 ohm resistor (R66) between the connector pin and the TEENSY module pin. &nbsp;When you get a chance take a look and let me know what<br />
you find. &nbsp;We&#39;ll move forward from there.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>**********Atlantis</p>

<p>&gt; Wiring checked out as:<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; 5 volts on red/black (power and ground) so it is getting good power, going to sensor.<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; 3 volts square wave on pin 15 and ground on input connector from sensor, picture from lstolp@gmail.com<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<br />
&gt; ground to 13 on teensy flat at 3 volts</p>

<p>Ok. &nbsp;I&#39;m hearing that when you look at pin 13 of the Teensy module the trace is a solid flat horizontal line at 3 volts.</p>

<p>If someone can take a look with an ohm-meter. &nbsp;Between Pin 15 of J2 (the off-board connector that goes to the brass flow meter and pin 13 of the<br />
Teensy module should be 100 ohms. &nbsp;The 100-ohm SMD resistor R66 provides the connection between these two pins. &nbsp;R66 is immediately adjacent to<br />
J2-pin 15. &nbsp;You should see:<br />
&nbsp; - a short from one side of the resistor to J2-15<br />
&nbsp; - a short from the other side of the resistor to Teensy-pin 13<br />
&nbsp; - 100 ohms from J2-15 to Teensy-pin 13</p>

<p>Not sure what else to suggest. &nbsp;I have a couple of crazy ideas but all of them are negated by the fact that the suspect hardware was working at one<br />
point.</p>

<p>If you get a chance to explore with the meter, let me know what you see.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
