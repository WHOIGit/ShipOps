========================================
<p>Initially, I started the pump&nbsp;and did not see a change in the pump discharge pressure gauge. The complete valve lineup (including vents and overboard) had been checked and all were open. I shut off the pump and Engineering got an alarm and came by. We started the pump again, confirming pressure downstream (23 psi) and flow to lab sinks, determined it was a faulty gauge, and replaced it. There was a blockage in the gauge port and it will probably have to be cleaned out periodically&nbsp;as part of routine maintenance to the system or during events of faulty gauge readings.</p>
