========================================
<p>Received zero flow status despite visible rotation of the RFI impeller. Assumed adafruit flowmeter impeller was likely clogged and then noted one cable (black) detatched from termination entirely and the other two barely in place. Opted to replace unit and the red and yellow cables also came off during the removal process.</p>

<p>New flowmeter is in service now and recording flow.</p>
