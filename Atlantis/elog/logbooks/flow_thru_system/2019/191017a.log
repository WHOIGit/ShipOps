========================================
<p>The pump went down (air locked) on 10/15.&nbsp; When the engineers got it going, the pressure had dropped to 10 psi.&nbsp; This pressure was not enough to keep the system flushing and flowing - the data were affected.&nbsp; The pump was eventually dismantled and rebuilt.&nbsp; A damaged O-ring was replaced.&nbsp; Several other spares were used.&nbsp; Paul Ruh said new spares were ordered via NS5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On 10/16 the engineers took the pump apart.&nbsp; After many attempts, they finally got it working (pressure now 22 psi) around 11:00 GMT 10/17</p>

<p>The data related to that system (SBE45 Thermosalinograph data and Fluorometer data) should not be used during the following time periods:</p>

<p>2019 Oct 15&nbsp; 16:40 GMT - 21:30 GMT</p>

<p>2019 Oct 16&nbsp; 04:00 GMT - 2019 Oct 17&nbsp; 12:30 GMT</p>

<p>The flow through system went down due to power outages on the ship.&nbsp; No flow:</p>

<p>2019 Oct 18&nbsp; 09:00 GMT - 12:20 GMT</p>

<p>Unknown cause - No flow through science instruments:</p>

<p>2019 Oct 21&nbsp; 14:50 GMT - 18:40 GMT</p>
