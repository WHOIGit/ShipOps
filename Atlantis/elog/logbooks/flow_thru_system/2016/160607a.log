========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The hoses and fittings we used for the NAAMES cruise diaphragm pump are presently in the bow thruster&nbsp; room.&nbsp; The flange with the banjo adapter is</span> <span style="font-size: large;">still connected to the system.&nbsp; The hoses and fittings are tie wrapped to the SS board (holding FL &amp; TSG).&nbsp; It seemed an appropriate place to store them so they would not go missing.&nbsp; The NAAMES group is likely coming back in Sept 2017 and we will need these items.</span></p>
