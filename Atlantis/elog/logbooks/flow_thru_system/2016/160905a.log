========================================
<p>2016-Oct-19</p>

<p>I cleaned the fluorometer 13:40-13:50 GMT.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:large">I cleaned the tubing for the flow thru system.&nbsp; The connector going into the SBE45 &quot;IN&quot; cracked while trying to replace tubing - replaced it.&nbsp; Also, put in some barb adapters in a few spots - last time it got cleaned, someone put pieces of different size hose directly together and hose clamped - seemed better to have a fitting in place.</span></p>
