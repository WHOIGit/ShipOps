========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">I cycled the power going to the IMET,  etc. as the port vaisala had gone out.&nbsp; Everything&nbsp; came back except the  SBE48.&nbsp; I hooked it up to the netbook at 9600 baud and it said &quot;not  logging:&nbsp; low battery&quot;.&nbsp; So I did &gt;StartNow and it started logging  again.</span></p>
