========================================
<p>During layup period much of schedule 80 plumbing was replaced by me.&nbsp; Engineers also replaced duplex strainer to a simplex strainer.&nbsp; All of this plumbing was fine with no leaks.&nbsp; I also made and hung a new stainless steel mounting panel for TSG, Fluorometer and SBE Pump.&nbsp; All Tygon tubing was replaced.&nbsp; After we had issues with priming the system we finally cut &amp; shortened tubing coming from the intake.&nbsp; Still did not prime well and air bubbles.&nbsp; Then Allison figured that going direct to fluorometer with one would work better.&nbsp; And it did.&nbsp; From there it flows to pump and then to TSG.&nbsp; Picture to come soon.</p>
