========================================
<p>~ 888 cubic feet of shelf space (including floor space directly under shelves) - some areas limited to packages with a dimension &lt; 18&quot;.&nbsp; Some accesses between unistrut shelf supports are also quite tight and limit availablility.&nbsp; The overhead area appears to have some more additional space, but it is quite difficult to utilize.</p>

<p>The floor has about 28 square feet of space that can be covered and piled high (as long as items can be secured) - there is a pole obstructing some space.</p>
