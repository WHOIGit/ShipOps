========================================
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;Changed the network layout so that the 1Gb switch in the Alvin Rack feeds the Main Lab directly.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;The Gaming Router is now connected off of the same 1Gb switch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; Before, the main lab was fed through the gaming switch.&nbsp; Hopefully this will make video transfers as fast as they can be.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Router's IP is 192.168.1.1 and pword is whoi1930&nbsp; ~Catie 29 April 16</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Created an Apple ID for SSSG.&nbsp; The username is sssg@atlantis.whoi.edu.&nbsp; Password and other information are in the usual place.&nbsp; No credit card was entered.&nbsp; IF we need to buy something, we should use the &quot;one time only&quot; credit card system.</span></p>

========================================
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; I upgraded Jonathan's Mac and .21 to El Capitan.&nbsp; Unfortunately Final Cut Pro no longer works on them.&nbsp; We don't have the right apple ID and password/ answer to personal questions to do a proper upgrade on Final Cut Pro, so we'll probably have to buy new copies and install them.</span></p>
