========================================
<p>I moved the gaming router that was in the Main Lab Video Rack to the<br />
computer lab.&nbsp; Then I connected the WAN side to the cabin net via an<br />
overhead network box at the aft end, inboard side of &quot;Mac Island&quot;.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; On the LAN side, one wire goes to the Main Lab 1G switch and the other<br />
goes to the 1G switch in the back of the Computer Lab Alvin Video Rack.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; This router was originally installed as a dhcp server for the video net.<br />
It still serves that purpose, as well as providing a path to our web site<br />
for Framegrabber.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The ip address is 192.168.1.1.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The wire runs through the overhead.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
