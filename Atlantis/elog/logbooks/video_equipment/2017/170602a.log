========================================
<p>If an Alvin video file is corrupted on a Samurai hard drive because the recorder got improperly shut down in the sphere or whatever, as happens on rare occasion, the video file IS RECOVERABLE. We did not know this before. SSSG has possession of Alvin's spare Samurai recorder for just this purpose (stored in video listas next to video rack). If you insert the hard drive into the Samurai, it should prompt for: a file was interrupted, do you want to repair it? Choose to repair the file. This could take a very long time, could be hours, depending on the size of the file. This is why they do not do this during an Alvin dive.</p>
