========================================
<p>The manual we have for our LTO decks does not give the correct procedure for accessing the maintenance functions of the decks.</p>

<p>I found a manual online for another flavor of LTO deck with maintenance mode instructions that do work for our decks.</p>

<p>It is on sssg_on_memory called: IBM_TS2250_LTO5_tape_drive_User_Guide_worksforourdecks.pdf</p>
