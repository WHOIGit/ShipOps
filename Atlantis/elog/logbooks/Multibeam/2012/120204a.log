========================================
<p>Timing, pitch, heading and roll calibrations done on em122.</p>
<p>The timing value did not change (it was 0 seconds, it still is 0 seconds) - if there had been an offset it should be entered into the installation parameters under &quot;Sensor Setup&quot; tab - &quot;Settings&quot; - Position delay (sec.):</p>
<p>The pitch offset changed from -0.45 degrees to -0.30</p>
<p>*The heading offset changed from 0.00 to 0.60 (Stand-alone heading) - this is the GYRO calibration.&nbsp; We had been using the Gyro for heading data, however, we have changed over to using the Phins -therefore, this offset is not really active and would only be relevant if we switched back to the Gyro for heading data - IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED THAT WE USE THE GYRO FOR HEADING DUE TO LARGE VARIATIONS IN HEADING CALIBRATION RESULTS (we did 3 sets of calibrations, none of which matched)</p>
<p>The heading data are now taken from the Phins system - using the Phins, the heading offset was calibrated to be 0.00</p>
<p>The roll offset changed from -0.09 to -0.11</p>
