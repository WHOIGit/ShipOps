<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The UPS had problems prior to this cruise beginning.&nbsp; It went into bypass mode, and had an Environment Fault &ndash; Invert Limitation (which apparently means there is some sort of short circuit in the output devices).&nbsp; Technical support was called.&nbsp; We were told to reseat the power module using the &ldquo;hot swap&rdquo; method in the manual.&nbsp; On the first attempt, everything was powered down (rather than a hot swap).&nbsp; The power module was reseated, but it came up the same way (in bypass, with the same fault).&nbsp; It was done again using the hot swap method (all em122 equipment was unplugged from the system for safety).&nbsp; This time there was a small explosions (maybe a few pops, it was so sudden, I&rsquo;m not sure) and some smoke.&nbsp; The power module was opened, and it was determined that a fuse had been blown.&nbsp; </span></span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A grand rush was made to get a new UPS unit and some fuses down the Barbados for us during the port stop.&nbsp; This arrived the night before we were to sail.&nbsp; We tried the fuse first.&nbsp; The system again went into bypass mode.&nbsp; We shut it down and went to install the other unit.&nbsp; We realized we should have written down the settings for the first unit, so we powered it back up.&nbsp; This time it went into a self-diagnostic mode and then there was a succession of small explosions form inside the unit.&nbsp; After the popping noises stopped, the unit could not be powered down (had to pull out the power module and put the battery in &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; to get it to power down).</span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--></span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The new unit was wired in and powered up.&nbsp; It went immediately into bypass mode &ndash; this time the message was telling us the battery was not connected.&nbsp; We tried reseating the battery tray and redoing the connect/disconnect switch many times, but it didn&rsquo;t help.&nbsp; We decided to run the em122 with the UPS in bypass mode and telephone technical support the next day (cruise was beginning and we had to do meetings and get science settled).</span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--></span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">  Technical support was called.&nbsp; Not that the other guy I spoke to was bad, but this guy (who was on call for the weekend) was very good.&nbsp; He said there was more than one fuse in the power module and if it had a problem fuses would keep blowing until they were all blown.&nbsp; He assured me that the battery pack from the old unit would be fine to install since it was reading the 188 volts that it should have been.&nbsp; He also said it was likely that one of the connectors had come loose during shipping in the new battery pack.&nbsp; We installed the old battery pack and got the UPS going in &ldquo;Protected mode&rdquo; without any further problems.&nbsp; We later opened the old battery pack and just as he said, a clip was undone.&nbsp; Once reconnected that battery read 189 volts, so it should be fine now.<!--EndFragment--> </span></span></meta>
