========================================
<p>Replaced 12v power supply in pre-amp witha spare that Kongsberg sent us.&nbsp; Old S/N is 1221115.&nbsp; New S/N is 1221061. </p>
<p>The lower set of lights would go dim at random times, and the signal would be unusable.&nbsp; So I changed the 12v power supply re Kongsberg's recommendation.&nbsp; The new unit is burning in right now, and things look ok so far.</p>
