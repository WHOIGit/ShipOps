========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">SEE BELOW EMAILS FOR DETAILS OF WHAT CHIEF SCI THINKS IS HAPPENING.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Peter Lemmond had a look at the raw data and feels confident that it is all there.&nbsp; He feels this might be an issue with the Caris software they are using to process the data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently aboard the Atlantis surveying off the Scotian? Shelf with EM122-118.<br />
<br />
SIS version 3.8.3<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;?<br />
<br />
I am seeing a problem that I thought had been resolved years ago.? First saw this on the CCGS Matthew's EM710<br />
installation.? The system drops a ping EVERY time a line is incremented (ie a new raw file.all is started).?<br />
For this system that means TWO pings lost -that is leaving an alongtrack &quot;gap&quot; in the order of 150 meters.<br />
<br />
If our ping rate was 10-20 Hz this might be forgivable (CPU very busy etc etc), but in this situation we are<br />
looking at a serious flaw/bug.? With only a few pings per minute (we are sounding in 4500-5000m of water), this<br />
is quite unforgivable.? There is NO way the SIS CPU is THAT busy !!<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for us out here?? To mitigate the affect I have stopped incrementing lines after every XBT<br />
upload and made lines two rather than one hour long. Our lines are 20-22 hours long so we are still loosing<br />
data.<br />
<br />
We have also seen a strange behavior in the SIS HWS when the &quot;night&quot; colour pallete is selected.? The system<br />
acts like it is VERY busy and is very slow to react to any mouse clicks. It is a bit better in &quot;dusk&quot; mode but<br />
not by much.? In fact I think this &quot;feature&quot; resulted in a complete SIS crash a few nights ago when a<br />
relatively young/new SIS operator was on watch.? Impatient and too many mouse clicks without wondering what was<br />
happening!!? Had to turn ship around and travel back a few miles -very expensive error.?<br />
New standing orders in place now at night -go back to day mode if any adjustments to SIS are required. Of<br />
course, the bridge officers are not that happy as a lot more glare for them to deal with when that happens.<br />
<br />
The HWS is the one supplied by you when the system was installed a year or so ago.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate a resolution to the first issue and some advice about the second.? I suspect a bad video<br />
card choice there so not much we can do now, but would like a plan to resolve it.<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance for your prompt response<br />

&nbsp; A little bit more information to think about....<br />
<br />
We have now determined that the swaths have NOT actually been dropped.? They are included at the start<br />
of the next &quot;line/file&quot; BUT their times are before the first valid position in the new file so they<br />
can not be positioned.<br />
<br />
It also appears that two swath pairs are being missed. Tjis appears to be quite a consitant problem<br />
throughout the dataset so far<br />

Example below.? Times at UTC<br />
