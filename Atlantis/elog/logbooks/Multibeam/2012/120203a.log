========================================
<p>Determined that 1pps pulse from ESE clock is rising, instead of falling, on the start of the second.&nbsp; Pulse is a 50% pulse, so the falling portion occurs at the .5 second mark. &nbsp; Result is that the clock is being set .5 seconds off.&nbsp; Need to fix the ESE clock.</p>
