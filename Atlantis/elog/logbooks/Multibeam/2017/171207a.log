<p>Hi Robbie,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken a look at the test files and don&#39;t see much of a difference<br />
between the PHINS configurations, unfortunately (screen captures of CUBE<br />
surfaces attached).</p>

<p>As we&#39;ve seen before, all three test files show the heading recorded in<br />
the .all file wandering by +/- 2-3 degrees on either side of the mean<br />
heading on time scales of 2-3 minutes. &nbsp;This wandering heading is<br />
different from the high-frequency yaw of the ship (typically 1 deg or less<br />
on time scales of ~10 sec in these files). &nbsp;The wandering is not a problem<br />
in itself, but it continues to correspond with the 2-3 minute period of<br />
the outer beam ripple (with no corresponding artifact at nadir).</p>

<p>In my mind this still points to a yaw stabilization issue as evidenced by<br />
the highly uneven ping spacing on the seafloor over many ping cycles (see<br />
attached). &nbsp;This doesn&#39;t appear to be a bulk offset in heading, since<br />
we&#39;ve already calibrated for that and the swath is generally oriented<br />
normal to the very-long-term ship track. &nbsp;My primary suspects remain: a<br />
discrepancy between the PHINS heading (or heading rate of change in the<br />
attitude velocity datagram) and the TRU interpretation of those inputs, or<br />
a discrepancy in timing between the PHINS and TRU.</p>

<p>At this point, we have to defer to Kongsberg&#39;s thoughts on these<br />
relationships between the heading and yaw stabilization / sounding spacing<br />
/ outer beam ripples. &nbsp;Please keep us in the loop on your dialogue and we<br />
will contribute whatever we can to the discussion.<br />
Kevin</p>
