========================================
<p>See attachments for upgrade instructions</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">Both HWS computers were upgraded from:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIS Version 4.1.3 Build 14&nbsp;&nbsp; DBVersion 24.0 CD generated Dec 13, 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIS Version 4.2.1 Build 33&nbsp; DBVersion 28.0&nbsp; CD generated Jun 24, 2015</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pu parameters, installation settings &amp; TOOLS/external sensors, etc settings were compared to screenshots taken from the primary HWS computer (black one</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that came with system from Kongsberg) - no substantial differences were found (a few new files appeared to have new additional settings, but</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settings that existed on both software versions were the same as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>One NOTE:&nbsp; SVP comes into COM3 on the HWS backup computer - it is COM2 on the black HWS computer</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a zipped version of the screenshots, etc. prior to upgrades attached - settings on the new version should match these (excepting, of course, user preferences).&nbsp; Copies of the pu-parameters dumps before and after the upgrade are also attached</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">TRU Software was also upgraded</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">There was concern that the modifications that Chuck Hohing from Kongsberg made in August would be lost.&nbsp; Therefore, we worked with Gregg Juergens (reference number KM:026060063)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">while performing the upgrade.&nbsp; Gregg sent some scripts and directions to &quot;get&quot; the beamweight files prior to starting, and then &quot;put&quot; them back afterward (in case the upgrade wrote over them).&nbsp; It was thought that Chuck had left copies of the &quot;original, factory default files&quot; and the &quot;modified files&quot; on the computer desktop - however, we searched both computers and came up empty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We sent the files to Gregg each time to check and make sure the modifications were there.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Initially, there were some problems with the install disk - none of the pre-scripted links to updates worked.&nbsp; We had to look at the script and then find the correct file on the disk and run it.&nbsp; This worked okay, although there were a few additional errors the first attempt through.&nbsp; Here are some highlights:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; missing MSVCR120.dll - directions say how to fix missing MSVCP120.dll - the same fix worked on the &quot;R&quot; file&quot;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; after running &quot;COMPARE&quot; the only item checked for upgrade was &quot;CPU&quot; - ran &quot;Upgrade selected&quot; that worked fine</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; step #3 said &quot;it might be necessary to upgrade firmware&quot; and the &quot;Update Firmware for Item&quot; button was available when I clicked on some of the items, so I started with TX_firmware, that went okay so I tried TX2_firmware next.&nbsp; That gave me a whole string of errors - pop up windows associated with each slot I think - but at the end, the message section said &quot;BURN:&nbsp; TX2_Firmware, OK&quot;.&nbsp; I tried the next also, and got the errors and again, in the end said okay.&nbsp; I then noticed that there was only one item that had a notation in the &quot;COMMAND&quot; column for &quot;Upd FW&quot; - since I'd done that one I exited the upgrade program</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; I reboot everything and reran &quot;COMPARE&quot; - this time nothing was marked and the &quot;Update Firmware for Item&quot; button was entirely grayed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 5)&nbsp; We then ran the &quot;put&quot; script Gregg sent to replace the beamweight files with the correctly modified ones.&nbsp; <em>NOTE: The &quot;put&quot; script he sent needed to be modified as he left out some &quot; ../../../&quot; in some of the directory changes which caused the system to try to change directories to ones that did not exist - this was easy to edit in, but BEWARE, if you go back and get the scripts from email to use them in the future!!!!</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;">OVERALL UPDATE INFORMATION:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="font-size: large;">After completing both upgrades (TRU and SIS) we reboot everything again, started SIS, and ran BIST.</span></span>&nbsp; The BIST was failing in more places than it should have been (we still have the three bad boards installed, so those should fail, but it was also failing TX Power Test.&nbsp; I tried re-seating the PSU 170V in the TRU, but that did not help.&nbsp; This test had actually also been failed prior to the upgrade as we were returning to port.&nbsp; That BIST test (returning to port after at32) was the first one run since the Ship's clean power outage and em122 UPS going down (see emails).&nbsp; Therefore, it is highly likely whatever happened to the PSU 170V happened during that clean power failure when the EM122 UPS failed to protect the load.</p>
<p>*** PSU 170V 302992 power supply S/N 08 44 001012 was replaced with the spare unit (SN 10 08 001011)&nbsp; NEED TO DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED WITH REPAIR!!!</p>
<p>After the PSU was replaced, the BIST test failure results appeared as expected, with the boards in positions 12, 23, and 24 having problems.</p>
<p>We did a bunch of board swapping and sending of results to Gregg to ensure that everything was &quot;OK&quot; before pinging (he wanted to make sure there were not additional failures).</p>
<p>We pinged for at least 12 hours (maybe more) on the black, original computer.&nbsp; Everything seemed to work, although the grid stopped displaying twice (was still gridding bu not on screen).&nbsp; We had quickly entered shallow water - so it is likely the grid engine got overwhelmed by the excessive cell size.&nbsp; Once the cell size was dropped substantially, this problem did not recur.</p>
<p>We only pinged for about an hour or two on the backup computer.&nbsp; It is the one that is still hooked up now (2015-Dec-09) in preparation for more testing on the transit to Barbados.&nbsp; Thus far, all seemed fine though.</p>

Subject / Summary: Chuck Modified Files for beamweights in TRU (he loaded these Aug.2 originally)

Encoding: HTML
========================================
<p>Attached are copies of the beamweight files - the versions that were altered by Chuck Hohing in Aug. 2015 to turm off shorted channels.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We did a &quot;get&quot; from TRU on Dec. 6. 2015 prior to the EM122, SIS upgrade and sent the files to Gregg Juergens who confirmed these were teh right files and sent them back to us to re-load into TRU after the upgrade to ensure the appropriate channels were turned off.</p>
