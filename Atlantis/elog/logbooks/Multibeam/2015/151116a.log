========================================
<p>EM122 SPARES INVENTORY - 2015-Nov-16</p>
<p>Spare TX36 board on ship now!&nbsp; We received a NEW TX36 board (SN 231647) and placed it into the em122 inventory.&nbsp; It was not installed, as we are awaiting </p>
<p>analysis from Norway with regard to the slots (Chuck Hohing turned off the shorted channels, but we don't want to risk damaging the board)</p>
