========================================
<p>UPS beeping again.</p>
<p>The setting has been changed so it only does it's battery check once a month.&nbsp; It seems it never passes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding the power button until the &quot;self diagnosis&quot; starts worked again to get it back on track.</p>
