========================================
<p>Another TX36 board went bad, identical failure to the first one which occurred in April 2014. Board was from same slot- #12. Data looked normal, LEDs looked normal, but failed BIST and showed no voltage at Br. 1 on the TX36 and TRU power tests. When board positions are swapped, problem follows the board.</p>
<p>Failed board is s/n 211543. This one was from the original stock of spares and was installed in slot 12 in April 2014 after the first TX36 board failure.</p>
<p>Installed spare board March 2, 2015. This spare was the board received back from Kongsberg and loaded on board in October 2014.</p>
<p>*Actually- Board from slot 24 is now in slot 12. The spare was installed in slot 24.*</p>
