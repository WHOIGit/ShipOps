<p>****************EMAIL TO KONGSBERG ABOUT PROBLEM</p>

<p>PROBLEM: &nbsp;The TRU is not coming up. &nbsp;The &quot;power good&quot; light on the&nbsp;<br />
PSU-170V 302992 board is staying dark. &nbsp;The other power lights and&nbsp;<br />
&quot;blinkies&quot; on the TRU seem normal.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: &nbsp;After the last cruise, I shutdown the TRU and PreAmp while we&nbsp;<br />
were still offshore. &nbsp;The UPS was still powered up and teh TRU and the&nbsp;<br />
PreAMP were still plugged into the UPS. &nbsp;When we got to the pier and&nbsp;<br />
switched to shore power, we went dark ship, losing even the ship&#39;s main,&nbsp;<br />
big UPS. &nbsp;At that time I ran around shutting down equipment. &nbsp;However, I&nbsp;<br />
neglected to shudown the UPS for the em122 (again, the PreAMP and TRU&nbsp;<br />
were not powered up during that time).</p>

<p>Yesterday, we went offshore for some engine testing, so I went to fire up&nbsp;<br />
the em122 for testing as well. &nbsp;I had switched everything over to the&nbsp;<br />
backup HWS (wanted to see if it was configured correctly). &nbsp;I did not look&nbsp;<br />
at the TRU lights right away, as I figured any problems would be related&nbsp;<br />
to the computer (as it had not been used in some time) and everything had&nbsp;<br />
been functioning properly when I powered down last. &nbsp;Initially, I did get&nbsp;<br />
a network connection to the TRU. &nbsp;I went to run a BIST test. &nbsp;We were in&nbsp;<br />
relatively shallow water. &nbsp;As the test ran, it failed some of the tests,&nbsp;<br />
including the TRU power test. &nbsp;Again, I assumed something was amiss with&nbsp;<br />
my connections, so I shut everything down and checked everything.&nbsp;<br />
Unfortunately, I did not save the failed BIST results before I did that.</p>

<p>This time, while powering up, I watched all the lights. &nbsp;It was then that&nbsp;<br />
I saw that the PSU-170V 302992 board &quot;power good&quot; light was not&nbsp;<br />
illuminating. &nbsp;This time, I could not make the network connection to the&nbsp;<br />
TRU at all (I do not know if the network connection had failed prior to&nbsp;<br />
the previous BIST test or not. I do know that when I had started SIS&nbsp;<br />
previously it had found the TRU at least initially, but not all of the PU&nbsp;<br />
sensor status lights were green).</p>

<p>One other thing - I was not aware that the ship was not on &quot;clean power&quot;&nbsp;<br />
during our short trip offshore. &nbsp;However, the TRU and PreAMP are going&nbsp;<br />
through their own UPS system, so I don&#39;t think that should matter.</p>

<p>THINGS I TESTED/TRIED:<br />
1) &nbsp;We had a spare PSU-170V 302992 board. &nbsp;So, I swapped boards. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<br />
spare board, which is marked tested &quot;good&quot; March 2016, also did not&nbsp;<br />
provide a &quot;power good&quot; green light. &nbsp;So, I swapped the boards back again&nbsp;<br />
(the originally loaded board is in the TRU now).</p>

<p>2) &nbsp;DON&#39;T &quot;THINK&quot; IT IS THE UPS - I powered everything down and unplugged&nbsp;<br />
it from the UPS. &nbsp;I powered up the UPS and gave it 3-4 hours to make sure&nbsp;<br />
the batteries had a chance to charge (not that we were using them). &nbsp;I ran&nbsp;<br />
the UPS self tests and everything looked fine. &nbsp;I measured the voltage&nbsp;<br />
coming out of the outlets that I was using for the em122. &nbsp;There are three&nbsp;<br />
breakers on the UPS. &nbsp;The first outlet was on breaker 1 - it measured 232&nbsp;<br />
volts. &nbsp;The second and third outlets were on breaker two. &nbsp;The second one&nbsp;<br />
measured 232 volts, the third was flaky. &nbsp;So, I plugged the third one into&nbsp;<br />
an outlet on the third breaker. &nbsp;I checked the voltages at the TRU end of&nbsp;<br />
the plugs as well - all looked good (~232 V). &nbsp;Still no light. &nbsp;As a final&nbsp;<br />
UPS check, I put the UPS into bypass mode and tried to power up the TRU.&nbsp;<br />
I did not get a 170 V green light.</p>

<p>3) &nbsp;I checked the test points on the PreAMP. &nbsp;They were reading correctly&nbsp;<br />
+12 V and -12 V.</p>

<p>4) &nbsp;I pulled out and checked every fuse I could find on the TRU - 2 on the&nbsp;<br />
board itself - both were good. &nbsp;4 on the TRU bottom section (near where&nbsp;<br />
the power comes in - all four good. &nbsp;2 more on the upper back portion of&nbsp;<br />
the TRU - both good.</p>

<p>5) &nbsp;I examined the PSU-170 V board and the area behind it looking for burn&nbsp;<br />
marks or bent connectors. &nbsp;Everything looked fine.</p>

<p>6) &nbsp;I removed the &quot;remote&quot; power box 9-pin connector from the TRU and&nbsp;<br />
tried powering the TRU from the actual TRU switch. &nbsp;Still no light. &nbsp;I can&nbsp;<br />
not remember, nor could I find information in the manuals about what would&nbsp;<br />
happen if the remote switch is already on and someone flips the switch on&nbsp;<br />
the TRU to &quot;ON&quot; also. &nbsp;I have had the back cover off of the TRU for a&nbsp;<br />
while, so although doubtful, someone could have flipped that switch.&nbsp;<br />
Could that blow something out?</p>

<p>7) &nbsp;I checked the continuity of all of the power cables.</p>

<p>I can not think of anything else to check.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely to me that both boards would be bad (unless of course,&nbsp;<br />
something I did while testing could have caused the same issue in both&nbsp;<br />
boards).</p>

<p>I need help troubelshooting this issue. &nbsp;We do not leave for the next&nbsp;<br />
cruise until August 19. &nbsp;However, I would like to take care of this&nbsp;<br />
sooner, rather than later. &nbsp;I am really hoping I am overlooking something&nbsp;<br />
simple, but I can&#39;t think of what that might be!</p>

<p>Help,</p>
