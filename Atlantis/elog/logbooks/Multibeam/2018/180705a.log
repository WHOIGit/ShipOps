Subject / Summary: Attitude Errors on em122 emanating from the SIMRAD EM string coming from the phins
Cruise: at40-03

========================================
<p><strong>SIMRAD EM string baud was changed back to 19,200 baud and 100 Hz.</strong>&nbsp; This solved the issue of the attitude errors on the em122.</p>

<p>The string had been changed to 115,200 baud 200 Hz back in Nov 2016 to alleviate MPC Overload errors on the phins.&nbsp; It was probably never causing the errors.&nbsp; At any rate, it needed to be changed back in order to fix the em122 attitude issue.&nbsp; See cruise report at40-03 for more information.</p>
