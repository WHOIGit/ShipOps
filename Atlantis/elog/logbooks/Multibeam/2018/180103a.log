========================================
<p>Use:</p>

<p>Tools-&gt;Custom-&gt;CreateGridFromAsciiFiles</p>

<p>You should be using &quot;filename.h.xyz&quot; file. The name doesn&#39;t matter, but it should just be a text file, 15 header<br />
lines, followed by lots of lat/lon/depth triplets.</p>

<p>You will need to give the grid a name, browse to the xyz file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grid will take a bit of time to create.&nbsp; Once the grid is created you need to</p>

<p>import it like any other grid (File - import ...)</p>
