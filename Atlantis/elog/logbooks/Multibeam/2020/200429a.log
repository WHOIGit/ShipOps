========================================
<p>ROBBIE ADDED:</p>

<p>Most of this is simply remove and replace with the newer version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exception are:<br />
-All the parts in the main lab are different sizes, and different mounts.&nbsp; The wiring will likely also need some rerouting.<br />
-The receive array has to be modified to accept new acoustic foam.<br />
-Inspect the cable transit pipes for corrosion.<br />

Hi</p>

<p>Looks like Mark did most of my work for me.</p>

<p>Two things you might notice- &nbsp;Inspecting the pipes for corrosion. &nbsp; And having the shipyard do the frame mods for the acoustic foam. &nbsp; &nbsp;I still need more information on the<br />
latter. &nbsp; (I have an email out.)</p>

<p>Anyway</p>

<p>Upgrade of EM122 multibeam to EM124, on the R/V Atlantis, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; Removal of the Transmit Transducer Modules from the Transducer Mounting Frame<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; Removal of the Receive Transducer Modules from the Transducer Mounting Frame<br />
This will involve removing any fairing from both arrays. &nbsp; This should be removed so as to able to be reinstalled if possible. Unbolt and lower the modules, release the<br />
wiring, open cable transits as needed, (I think that there are two sets), remove the wires from the junction box in the main lab. &nbsp; Pull all the wires out and remove modules.<br />
(owner will likely pick two transmit and two receive modules to keep as spares, all the rest can be disposed of.)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Inspect the transit pipes.<br />
Once the cable have been removed, the transit pipes can be inspected for corrosion. &nbsp; Repairs or replacement will need to be done if problems are found. &nbsp; This could delay<br />
other parts of this procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp; * &nbsp; Removal and bead blasting cleaning of the Transmit Transducer Mounting Frame<br />
&nbsp; * &nbsp; Removal and bead blasting cleaning of the Receive Transducer Mounting Frame<br />
&nbsp; * &nbsp; Modifying both frames to accept new acoustic foam.<br />
These frames will be reused. &nbsp; They will also need to be slightly modified for the installation of acoustic foam. &nbsp;This will involve the drilling of about 120(?) holes to<br />
install bolts to hold the foam. &nbsp; The faom will be owner supplied. &nbsp; (Kongsberg will supply)</p>

<p>&nbsp; * &nbsp; Cleaning of the Receive and Transmit In Hull Transducer Casings<br />
&nbsp; * &nbsp; Preservation and Painting of the Receive and Transmit in Hull Transducer Casings<br />
&nbsp; * &nbsp; Removal and Installation of the Zinc in the Receive and Transmit in Hull Transducer Casings<br />
The casings will need to be cleaned, zinc to be replaced, and protective coating will need to be repaired/restored as needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp; * &nbsp; Installation of the Transmit and Receive Transducer Frames after Cleaning and Casing Painting<br />
This will need to be done in coordination with the surveyors and Kongsberg.</p>

<p>&nbsp; * &nbsp; Assistance in the installation of the Transmit and Receive Transducers into the in hull arrays.<br />
This will need to be done in coordination with Kongsberg. &nbsp; This will involve pulling the cables, reassembling the cable transits, reinstalling the fairing, etc..</p>

<p>&nbsp; * &nbsp; Removal of the old electronics in the Main Lab.<br />
Remove old electronics with out damage, the owner will keep these. &nbsp; Remove the existing mounts from the bulkhead. &nbsp;The new electronics, while similar, are smaller and do not<br />
have the same mount footprint. &nbsp; New mounts will be installed in the same area. &nbsp; Shipyard will work with the owner to determine the location of the mounts.</p>

<p>&nbsp; * &nbsp; The usual crane, truck or fork lift service for moving the transducer crates in and out of the dry dock and moving the array frames for cleaning and lifting the array<br />
frames out and back into the casings in the hull.</p>

<p>Are we putting the SATs and HATs in here?</p>
