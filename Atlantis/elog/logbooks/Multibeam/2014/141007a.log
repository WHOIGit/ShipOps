========================================
<p>UPS tripped offline again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Turns out that you don't need to restart everything.&nbsp; The UPS does not shut of it's output when it restarts.&nbsp;&nbsp; All you have to do is push the &quot;I&quot; button when it says push &quot;I&quot; to restart.&nbsp; (not sure of the exact grammer)&nbsp; Might be good to double check this with a load and the system off once we get in port.&nbsp; But it seems to work.</p>
