Hello,<br />
<br />
What you can do is pull the power module out and reseat it. Then press the UPS power button for 3 seconds. Then wait 3 seconds.<br />
Then press the power button 3 seconds again.<br />
This should correct the problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Hi Corry,<br />
<br />
I spoke to you back in 2012 regarding problems with a UPS.&nbsp; I am hoping you are still there at Eaton, as we are having an issue<br />
with our newer UPS now.<br />
This is with regard to the Powerware UPS Model PW9135G5000-XL3U serial number CE216A1029.&nbsp; It alarmed last night.&nbsp; THe alarm was<br />
&quot;Power Module Fault&quot; which is listed as an alarm that requires Eaton Service - we are presently at 28 degree 23.5 N, 87 degees<br />
22.8 W - Gulf of Mexico - how soon can you be here :)<br />
<br />
The additional information the system gave was:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC Bus + Too Low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Required<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alarm U028<br />
<br />
We are presently running a survey using the equipment that is meant to be protected by this UPS, so we are unable to unhook<br />
everything and try powering completely down.&nbsp; We are running in bypass mode with an &quot;unprotected load&quot;.&nbsp; In a couple hours we<br />
will be done with the survey and try this, and then probably try to call you.<br />
<br />
Can you help us?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
