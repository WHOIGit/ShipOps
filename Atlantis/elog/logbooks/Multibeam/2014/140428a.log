========================================
<p>TX36 Transmitter Board in slot #12 went bad per BIST test, even though LEDs were fine.This was serial #212175.</p>
<p>Replaced with TX36 board in spares. Serial #211543. </p>
<p>No more TX36 boards left in spares.</p>
<p>However, per Kongsberg, if a middle board goes bad it can be swapped with an outer board in an emergency and then you just lose your outermost beams that you probably don't care much about anyway.</p>
