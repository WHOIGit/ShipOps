========================================
<p>Replaced the batteries in the UPS.&nbsp; This seems to have made the UPS functional again, in spite of the manufactures claim that we needed a new power module.&nbsp; </p>

========================================
<p>UPS switched to &quot;unprotected mode, fault is U191, battery module fault.&nbsp; These are the new batteries.&nbsp; Loose connection somewhere?&nbsp; The multibeam runs at 26% load most of the time, but there seem to be some peaks over 60%.&nbsp; Was able to restart the UPS and the fault is gone, has not come back within a week or so.</p>
