========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">ftp creates the serial sound velocity for the em122. It currently does not start at boot,<br />
since it needs the data before it can send it out.<br />
<br />
# this creates the Sound Velocity and writes it to a sqlitedb<br />
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/db_driven_data/status_screen/ssw_feeder.pl &amp;<br />
<br />
# this will grab the ssv and write it out to the serial port using ttyS1 # on ftp<br />
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/db_driven_data/status_screen/write_svt.pl &amp;<br />
<br />
I started them both up since they were not running..<br />
