========================================
<p>SIS stopped plotting the survey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trackline working, coverage working, but no display of the survey data and no display of realtime depth.&nbsp; Restarted SIS with same survey and settings and all is well.&nbsp; This is the third for fourth time it's done this on this cruise.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's possible that we have agrivated it by using the SIS computer for screen grabs, but that does not excuse it.&nbsp; This software sucks.</p>
