========================================
<p>We question the survey angles.</p>
<p>The numbers from IMTEC survey are not consistent.&nbsp; The angles listed for the hippie plate, the TX and the RX are not clear. &nbsp; &quot;Bow up&quot; and &quot;Bow down&quot; do not have consistent signs.&nbsp; While the patch test has probably compensated for this, it's not right.&nbsp; The hippie plate is definitely higher at the fwd end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be 3 survey points at each end of each the TX and RX.&nbsp; I have not located those.&nbsp; Anyway, this stuff should be checked and the signs should be confirmed.&nbsp; </p>
