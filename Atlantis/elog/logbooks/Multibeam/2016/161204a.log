font-family:Arial">Artifact:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have been chasing down the cause of an artifact for the past 6 months, that has likely been present since our multibeam was installed in 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The artifact is described as:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial">&ldquo;</span>A periodic alternating deep/shallow bias extending across the swath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The surface shown below is illuminated to show the corresponding dark shadows extending across the track while the ship drives approximately south.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The amplitude of the bias scales with the angle from nadir, approaching 1% of water depth on the outer beams (depth profile drawn across upper left of surface is shown in lower right window).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the starboard side is generally biased shallower when the port side is deeper, and vice versa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">This artifact appears to exist in data examples going back to 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its amplitude might technically be within spec for this system; however, it is a periodic, non-random bias that complicates processing and visualization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The example below exaggerates the effect visually due to shading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">This is similar to what we might see with an error in the vessel roll data, but the depth artifact does not appear to scale with roll period or amplitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The artifact comes and goes over the course of many pings and many roll cycles (more discussion below).&rdquo;</p>

font-family:Arial">There is a very long email trail related to this topic that starts back in about July.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The search for a cause has included:</span></p>

yes">&nbsp; </span>So, the system was re-configured so that the position data to the em122 is now coming in via the phins.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This seemed to make a positive improvement in the presence of the artifact, but did not entirely eradicate it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">This also added a problem, in that the em122 does not really like receiving position data at a low rate (right now it is getting 4800 baud and 1 Hz because that was the only output port available on the phins).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The plan is to implement this change for the long term.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, during the transit to Easter Island, we will need to a make some changes in the phins port configurations (remembering that the data rates /baud rates have to be the same for both the input and output on the phins ports).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Possible courses of action:</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Change the back-up phins GPS from 1850 at 4800 baud to something at 9600 baud, 1 Hz that could be paired with the ADCP/dslog port &ldquo;D&rdquo; on phins</span></p>
<p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol;

12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Change the ADCP feed / dslog feed to 4800 baud and put it on a port with the 1850 GPS (either &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rdquo;) &ndash;this would open up a port &ndash; I am not sure if anything else is using the ADCP/dslog feed.</span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">We have also been getting some errors on the em122 related to 1 pps not coming in.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Rebooting the TRU (et.al) has cleared this up, but it seems likely that it is related to the data rate issue (as it never happened prior to this change).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So far, each time the error has occurred, the system has been sitting idle for at least a day, and suddenly, we need to ping to get a depth for an ongoing science activity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, thus far, I have been unable to research the error further (ie. Is it really not getting the 1 pps at all??)</span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">Another issue, that occurred one time so far, is that the phins got a &ldquo;MPC Overload&rdquo; error.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Right around the same time the position on the em122 started going red.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time the parameters were set to allow the em122 to use dead-reckoning if the position was absent or bad (that setting has been changed now).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, the position displayed on our em122 grid started moving off to the west.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We called the bridge only to discover that they were driving straight down the line still.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After some investigation it was found that the position the phins was reporting was in no way matching the CNAV position coming in to the phins (can see by looking at expert view in ixRepeater software).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So far, this error has not recurred.</span></p>

yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>4)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upgraded phins firmware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This does not seem to have helped, and hed the added detriment of changing the sign convention for the PRDID TSS string we&rsquo;ve been sending to Sonardyne without any warning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was first discovered during a dredging activity, when the beacon position was seen to be bouncing all over the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It as later confirmed by recording data from two different phins ports and (according to their documentation) getting two opposite roll values.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We sent the data to iXBlue and they confirmed that the documentation needed to be changed to reflect the opposite roll convention for the PRDID string.</span></p>
