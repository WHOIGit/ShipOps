========================================
<p>Chuck Hohing from Kongsberg replace the two bad TX36 cards.&nbsp; These were in slots 23 and 24, although that's not really relivent, as they were in different slots when they first failed.&nbsp; (slot 12, the one with the 6 bad elements.)&nbsp; System passed all tests after this repair.&nbsp; </p>

Subject / Summary: Upgraded SIS from  4.2.1  to 4.3.2

========================================
<p>Upgraded SIS from from&nbsp; 4.2.1&nbsp; to 4.3.2.&nbsp; No problems, but lots of notes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>CPU firmware was called for, this just happens as part of the upgrade.&nbsp; No issues.<br />
    <ul>
        <li>Firmware upgrade to CPU gave the initial appearance of needing a firmware upgrade to the RX and TX firmware.&nbsp; This is just some sort of anomally, once you do a reboot, the message goes away. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use the &quot;Save All&quot; button to save both the PU parameters and the user parameters.&nbsp; (note, the &quot;user&quot; settings includes all the sensors and offset, hardly &quot;user&quot; settings, but that's the way Kongsberg makes it.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, you will get a message that says &quot;Configuration is generated for serial #118, do you wan to change it&quot;&nbsp; (yes or no)&nbsp; Say NO!&nbsp; This is asking you if you want to change the serial number.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not asking if you want to change something about the configuration.&nbsp; I have not idea why this is even in the software.</li>
    <li>&quot;Save all&quot; works well, but when you recall the settings, it takes a LOOOOONNNNGGGG time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows will announce that the program is not responding.&nbsp; Ignore that.&nbsp; It takes like 5-10 minutes to finish.&nbsp; When it's done, it will say &quot;Settings have been imported, restart SIS to apply new settings&quot;. &nbsp; </li>
    <li>For some reason, the default path for saving this is odd, it goes to screendumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
