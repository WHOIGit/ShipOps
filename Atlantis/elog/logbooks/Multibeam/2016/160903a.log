========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">A EM122 Patch test was done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The upcoming at37-05 cruise relies heavily on the em122.&nbsp; Therefore, they pushed for the ship to complete </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">a patch test prior to that cruise, on the transit to Newport.&nbsp; With the Captain's help, we found some time to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">complete the survey prior to reaching the Panama Canal.&nbsp; Through Dan F. (and others) we enlisted the help </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">of Vicki Ferrini and Paul Johnson from the Multibeam Oversight COmmittee to help us find appropriate tracks</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">to use.&nbsp; In preparation for the surveys, screenshots were made of all of the relevant offsets, and a pu_parameter dump<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">was performed.</span></p>
<p>****email 2016-August-26 from Paul Johnson</p>
<p>It should be fine to calibrate the pitch, heading and roll over a period of time. &nbsp;This exercise should<br />
only be a verification of the biases, with hopefully only very minor adjustment to the static offsets,<br />
unlike starting with a blank slate as when a system is newly installed, &nbsp; &nbsp;However, that said, you will<br />
want to apply the correction from each test before conducting the next test, in order to avoid any<br />
potential &ldquo;cross-talk&rdquo; between the pitch, heading, and roll bias determinations.<br />
<br />
On another note, I went digging this morning and there was a patch test run for the system in 2014 during<br />
an ECS cruise on the Mendocino Ridge (this was a group from CCOM led by Andy Armstrong). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
We can help look for a suitable location (depth and seafloor geometry) along the route if you want (what<br />
port are you departing from, sorry if I missed this in another email). &nbsp;<br />

<p>*******************ANOTHER EMAIL FROM PAUL SUGGESTING SURVEY LINES AND GIVING FURTHER CALIBRATION ADVISE</p>
<p>Hi Everyone -<br />
For Kongsberg the normal order is Roll, Pitch, Heading, and then Roll again. &nbsp;This is done as the Roll is often<br />
the largest contributor to errors and is the easiest of the 3 biases to detect. &nbsp;That said, there are competing<br />
views that the order should be Pitch, Heading, and Roll as this method accounts for bleeding from the pitch and<br />
heading errors into the roll immediately, instead of having to redo the roll at the end. &nbsp;For most modern<br />
multibeam systems, the latency is basically undetectable, unless it is REALLY bad, especially with a deep water<br />
system because of the cell size and the fuzziness of the slopes that you are using to detect the latency with<br />
(basically I am saying if you don&rsquo;t have time, you probably do not need to check it). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I plotted up the route that you are taking from Jamaica to Panama and it is not wonderful for conducting pitch<br />
and heading calibration on. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have attached a figure to this email showing the regional bathymetry (left) and<br />
the slopes for the area (right), along with the ship track that was sent out. &nbsp; Looking at areas that have<br />
slopes between 15 and 30 degrees (green in the slope figure), especially along the planned route, &nbsp;there are not<br />
a whole lot of choices, especially at an appropriate working depth for the EM122. &nbsp;I have identified one<br />
potential candidate, but it is shallower than I like for an EM122, the slopes are variable, and I put it on the<br />
edge of the existing multibeam data trying to maximize the slopes. The heading lines are separated from the<br />
middle pitch line by 1 water depth (1400 meters) to avoid refraction effects when determine the heading bias. &nbsp;<br />
I have put the points (decimal degrees) that make up this survey in the table below. The pitch line should be<br />
run back and forth, while each heading line needs to be run once, but in the same direction. &nbsp; <br />
<br />
Longitude &nbsp;Latitude &nbsp;Line<br />
-79.573452 15.179916 Pitch<br />
-79.529722 15.100507 Pitch<br />
-79.561933 15.185827 Heading 1<br />
-79.518201 15.106417 Heading 1<br />
-79.584971 15.174005 Heading 2<br />
-79.541242 15.094595 Heading 2<br />
<br />
For the roll I would wait until you are down towards the end of your transit (you can do a rough roll check in<br />
the shallower depths, but I would really want to redo it in the deeper water). &nbsp;At the southern portion of the<br />
transit &nbsp;you will be in ~3500 meters of water and have flat seafloor, this will work much better for roll than<br />
doing it in the shallower depths. &nbsp; The points below (decimal degrees) define a 4 nautical mile line that is<br />
along your track.<br />
Longitude Latitude<br />
-79.71118918 11.03320434<br />
-79.71976005 10.96682555<br />
<br />
Hopefully you are not already passed by the pitch location, I am also hopeful that I haven&rsquo;t made a mistake in<br />
the calculations for the lines (this was thrown together really rapidly as I was out for the day). &nbsp;<br />
