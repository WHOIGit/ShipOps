Subject / Summary: Nadir - too much penetration at Nadir
Cruise: at18-13

========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">We have seen times when the em122 has too much penetration at Nadir.&nbsp; The crosstrack shows a falsely dropped center area, and the data at and surrounding the center are bad.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Suggestions from Kongsberg to alleviate this issue:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjust FiIter Settings under runtime parameters - filters and gains (see email snippet #2 below)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">2)&nbsp; Alter the Along Direction of the beams - under runtime parameters - sounder main - this option worked the best for me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">3)&nbsp; Slowdown - if the problem may be resulting from speed or sea state - SEE EMAIL SNIPPET 1 BELOW - look at the Mode the TRU is running in (Shallow, Medium, Deep) to help indicate whether the TRU is compensating for signal noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">4)&nbsp; Sometimes need to restart TRU - this should not normally be necessary, but sometimes this makes the most improvement in the data &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">SNIPPETS FROM EMAILS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">1)&nbsp; Penetration at nadir can happen when the bottom is flat and composed of soft sediment.&nbsp; Normally, steering the beams as you did is all that is required to<br />
resolve the problem. You do not need to restart the system or stop and start pinging to get filter settings recognized, those changes are sent down to the TRU<br />
immediately upon your selection and are applied on the next ping.&nbsp; If the bottom conditions hadn't changed (flat and soft) but ambient noise levels increased<br />
with speed and sea state, then the TRU may have been forced to use a deeper mode setting to compensate for signal loss. A longer pulse length and increased<br />
power levels can cause problems at nadir.&nbsp; I don't have an answer for why the data seemed better after a reboot, my guess is that you hadn't given the TRU<br />
enough time to apply your runtime setting changes; they were used immediately after restarting SIS.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">2)&nbsp; Penetration at nadir in shallow water especially with soft sediments is a known issue. Refer to page 289 and 290 in the EM122 SIS reference manual which<br />
explains the Along Direction and Auto Tilt settings. Also there is a penetration filter which is explained on page 297. These are the settings you need to try<br />
when you see this nadir effect. Also what depths were you in at the time? In the future, screenshots and data will be helpful in analysis. You can always ftp<br />
us some lines of data when you have questions on data quality. It would be interesting to look at the lines with dual swath on and then off..<br />

Subject / Summary: HDDS.exe Error

Encoding: HTML
========================================
<p><span style="font-size: large;">HDDS is the process that reads the information from the *.all files and generates the gridded information in the GEO display.&nbsp; If the HDDS process has<br />
encountered a problem reading a file you may encounter a crash of that process.&nbsp; The DDS process is still writing the data to the *.all files and you can<br />
restart the HDDS process by selecting &quot;tools -&gt; restart HDDS&quot; in SIS instead of restarting the whole SIS application.&nbsp; This will prevent you from losing any<br />
of the collected raw data, but there will still be a hole in the gridded display.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">***Don't let your fragmentation levels get over 8 percent of the hard disk,<br />
this can slow down the read/write speeds on the DDS and HDDS processes and cause you performance problems.<br />

Subject / Summary: UPS Battery Fault

========================================
<p>Bosun reported the mulitbeam in the main lab was beeping (this is the second time he has pointed this out to me - it also happened on 3Nov2011)</p>
<p>The UPS indicated a &quot;BATTERY FAULT&quot;</p>
<p>I monkeyed with it, and ran a manual battery test a couple of times and it managed to come back saying &quot;BATTERY OKAY&quot; -&nbsp; before I ran the test, it was indicating &quot;LOAD UNPROTECTED&quot; which was the condition we were in when I last had problems with the PreAMP (i.e I believe the PreAMP lights were unevenly lit - and the voltages across the terminals inside were different - because the UPS was not protecting the load.&nbsp; Once it passed the Battery test it went back to ONLINE and LOAD PROTECTED</p>
<p>I am downloading the UPS manual now.&nbsp; I am not sure if we ever got one - I've never seen it.</p>
<p>SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE UPS:</p>
<p>model:&nbsp; PW9135G5000-XL3UHW</p>
<p>S/N CC021A0031</p>

<p>Not saying for sure that the above settings are correct - I'm not sure who set this up, but they seem to be &quot;mostly&quot; working so far.</p>
