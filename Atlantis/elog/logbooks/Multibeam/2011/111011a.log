========================================
<p>The bottom light on each card in the PreAmp was dimmer than the top light.&nbsp; Kongsberg asked me to measure the voltages in the middle compartment of the PreAmp (see emails below).&nbsp; The tp1 to tp3 voltage was 12.16, but the voltage from tp2 to tp3 was only 3.7 volts. &nbsp; </p>
<p>It was suggested that I check the power to the unit if both voltages were not about 12 volts.&nbsp; I did so, and in the course of checking discovered the UPS was in Auto Bypass mode (the present output/throughput was good, but I don't know if it had been over the past 4 days the unit had been on).&nbsp; I set the UPS to ONLINE MODE and restarted everything.&nbsp; RIght now the voltages are good (both about 12).&nbsp; I will watch over time and see if they stay this way.</p>
<p>As a side note - one time when the unit needed to be re-powered, it appeared that the bottom lights were out altogether (may have been very dim).&nbsp; The data had looked bad, prompting the decision to reset.&nbsp; On re-powering, they looked good.</p>

<p>**************************EMAILS REGARDING PROBLEM</p>
<p>Hello Allison,<br />
<br />
Both LED's should be the same brightness, I suspect you might have a power supply issue.<br />
<br />
The PreAmp has a couple of test points on the backside of the second door. Use the key to open the outer door, then open the<br />
second door. What voltages do you see at the two test points? You should see + 12 and - 12 volts between tp1 and tp3 and tp2<br />
and tp3. Ground is the middle test point.<br />
<br />
If you don't see +/- 12 volts, I would reseat the power supply, check input voltage to the PreAmp, and cycle power.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any questions.<br />
<br />

MY GENERAL EMAIL DESCRIBING PROBLEM:<br />
<br />
I'm wondering about the<br />
lights on the PreAmp (see attached photo). We are not presently pinging,<br />
but the PreAmp and TRU are on, and the software is up and ready to hit the<br />
&quot;ping&quot; button. The system has been up for about 5 days. We stopped<br />
pinging within the last 24 hours. I just looked at the PreAmp and noticed<br />
that the bottom light is way, way dimmer than the top. They are both on,<br />
but the bottom light is barely visible compared to the top. Is this<br />
normal? I have only really looked at these lights at start-up, and<br />
they've so far been very bright. The only other time I noticed them not<br />
being so bright was one time when I went to shutdown the PreAmp (the data<br />
were looking poor, so I was going to restart everything) and the bottom<br />
light appeared to be out (in retrospect, it may have been really dim like<br />
now).<br />
<br />
The JASON is working in the water, so I can't turn the pinging on right<br />
now to see what will happen (otherwise I would).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
