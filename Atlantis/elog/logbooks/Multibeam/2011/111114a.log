<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">DISCUSSION ON RUNNING MULTIBEAM IN RESTRICTED WATERS</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&quot;otherwise&quot; ....<br />
I am sorry to belabor this point but I have to make sure we don't shoot ourselves in the foot.<br />
I just spoke with David F and we are on the same page now.&nbsp; We just have to make sure that<br />
the data not be stored or kept.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the data must be discarded or deleted after<br />
analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are caught down the road for whatever unforeseen reason with the MB<br />
data it will hurt us significantly in obtaining research clearances.&nbsp; We can not have that<br />
happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
If we want to keep the data for future analysis - then I must write letters for<br />
permission... like right now.&nbsp; But I don't believe that is the intention here.<br />
<br />
So if the data can be thrown out after the test is completed, the please continue to test<br />
inside EEZ and in the Med.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

&gt; Okay, it sounds from this one like it should not even be tunred on inside the EEZ's.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Unless I hear otherwise, I will assume the I should not run the system inside the Med<br />
&gt; within any of the EEZ's excepting if I just want to test the system.&nbsp; If I do testing I<br />
&gt; will not record any data.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; I do not anticipate needing to do any testing by that point, except possibly when we are<br />
&gt; getting close to the end of the transit, in order to do some final checks.<br />

&gt; &gt; Hello all,<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Just to make sure I am understanding correctly.&nbsp; This is to run the EM122 before<br />
&gt; &gt; entering the Med correct?<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; I really hate constantly being the bearer of bad news about this but there are 3 EEZ's<br />
&gt; &gt; to pass through before the entrance.&nbsp; Spain, Portugal and Morocco so we need to be<br />
&gt; &gt; careful.<br />
&gt; &gt; Technically the data received from mutilbeam &quot;tests&quot; should be discarded.<br />
&gt; &gt; I am not so sensitive when we are outside the Med, its when we get inside the Med that<br />
&gt; &gt; has me concerned.<br />
&gt; &gt; Inside the Med there is Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Italy, Malta, Lybia before coming<br />
&gt; &gt; into Greece's EEZ.<br />
&gt; &gt; If you want to continue operating the EM122 the whole way into the Med and onto Greece<br />
&gt; &gt; I will have to write letters asking permission to do this.&nbsp; I would very much like to<br />
&gt; &gt; not bother our State Dept at this point in time though. They are working the front<br />
&gt; &gt; lines to help ensure our upcoming port calls in Piraeus go smoothly as possible by<br />
&gt; &gt; working with the Greek embassy and hopefully the port authorities in Piraeus.<br />
&gt; &gt; Submitting letters asking permission this late in the game is not looked upon<br />
&gt; &gt; favorably for us.<br />
&gt; &gt; Something to think about.<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />

&gt; &gt; &gt; I see no problem collecting EM122 data on the transit into the Med. We are using<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; this transit to evaluate the performance of the system in varying field conditions<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; and will not be disseminating or publishing the collected data beyond those persons<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; needed to complete the evaluation. This is in keeping with standard practices of<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; operating instruments without formal clearance for the purpose of engineering<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; assessments and calibration, where none of the data will be used for scientific<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; purposes or become part of the public record.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please let me know if you have any questions<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
