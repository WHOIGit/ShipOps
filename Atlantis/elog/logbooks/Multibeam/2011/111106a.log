========================================
<p>WE've been getting error messages that &quot;GGA is missing from COM1&quot; - the TRU is apparently missing a GGA string every, exactly 12 minutes and 30 seconds once it starts happening.</p>
<p>We don't know if it is something with the em122 system/softwre, or somethinfg with the CNAV.</p>
<p>I tried feeding the 90-D GPS to the TRU instead to see if the error went away (changed to 9600 baud, eliminated all strings except GGA &amp; ZDA) - this did not work - error messages increased substantially</p>
<p>I also tried up'ing the baud rate of the CNAV to 19200 baud - this doesn't seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time I try something, I wait until I am actually seeing the error message, as we sometimes go hours without it (usually it disappears during the night)</p>
