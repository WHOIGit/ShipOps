========================================
<p>The following feeds were added to the EM122 with the addition of the Seapath:</p>

<p>-Com 3: Serial attitude from Seapath Com 9</p>

<p>-Com 4: Serial GPS from Seapath Com10</p>

<p>-UDP6: UDP attitude/velocity from Seapath port 3001</p>

<p>-1PPS from Seapath 1PPS port via temporary cable run</p>

<p>*****IT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN CHANGING THE ACTIVE POSITION/ATTITUDE SOURCES FROM COM1/COM2/UDP5 to COM3/COM4/UDP6 TO GO TO INSTALLATION PARAMETERS &gt; INPUT SETUP AND DESELECT &quot;ZDA CLOCK&quot; FROM THE POSITION SENSOR YOU ARE DEACTIVATING AND RESELECT FOR THE POSITION SOURCE YOU ARE ACTIVATING******&nbsp;</p>
