========================================
<p>S.M.A.R.T status of hard drive D: in the HWS computer was showing bad on boot 3/2/2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Replaced drive with a new 2TB and copied all data over from the failing drive.</p>

<p>The only thing I was unable to copy over was the sis database file due to an IO error. This caused SIS to not be able to open. I renamed D:\sisdata\common\database\sis_orig from August 7 2018 to ...\sis and I was once again able to re-open sis. I re-imported all PU parameters and user settings from September-November 2018 (after Chuck&#39;s August 2018 visit), and that is now the current configuration.</p>

<p>Will verify with Chuck on 3/5/19 when he arrives that the old database did not screw anything else up.</p>
