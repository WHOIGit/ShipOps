Subject: INCORRECT GRAVITY TIE VALUE
Cruise: at37-08

========================================
<p>The value for the mGal's at Pier was entered incorrectly during the Dec. 5, 2017 gravity tie.&nbsp; I, Allison, performed the entire land tie portion with Joe McCabe.&nbsp; I then got them set up to do the pier side portion.&nbsp; I do not know exactly what happened, but the mGal at pier value was entered incorrectly.&nbsp; Although there was an extreme change in the Bias, I apparently had not explained the proof checking well enough, as no one caught this error.&nbsp; So, the BIAS used for at37-06 Teske, at37-07 transit, and at37-08 Cheadle was incorrect.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When the Cheadle group went to check out the gravity data during the transit back to Chile, they noticed the data were skewed by about 360 mGals.&nbsp; This is when I pulled out the paperwork and found the error.&nbsp; Stefano Suman was on board, so I grabbed him and he walked me through calculating the correct BIAS.&nbsp; The new, correct BIAS was given to the at37-08 group and included as part of their data package.&nbsp; I emailed the information to the at37-05 group.&nbsp; I have also emailed Andreas Teske about the data on his cruise.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE DATA THAT ARE ALREADY ARCHIVED (AT37-06) AT WHOI AND R2R.</p>
