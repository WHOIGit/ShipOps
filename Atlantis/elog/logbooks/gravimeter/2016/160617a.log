========================================
<p><big>This afternoon, the malf light was noticed lit on the gravimeter.&nbsp; We called Tom Lanigan about the problem.&nbsp; He and Steve Falutico came down and swapped out a couple of gyros.&nbsp; That did not solve the problem.&nbsp; We were heading to sea, so the gyros were powered down and the gimble secured.&nbsp; <br />

<p><big>Tom and Steve will return to repair the unit in July when we return.</big></p>
