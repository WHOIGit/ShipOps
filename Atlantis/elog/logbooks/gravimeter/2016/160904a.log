========================================
<p>CATIE'S NOTES FROM 2016:</p>
<p>Make sure the number shown in the LED window is stable (should be ~11.9)<br />
Switches: Right switch should be up, left switch down or up (right switch turns on the light inside; left switch reports temperature in one position and voltage in the other) <br />
<br />
Set the land meter on the round plate<br />
<br />
Level the bubbles. Do the right leveling knob first, then the upper left knob.<br />
<br />
The small silver knob is locked when all the way clockwise for transport. Turn to the left when taking measurements.<br />
<br />
Use the large dial knob to dial until you just &quot;kiss&quot; the black dot when coming in from the left. This is where you take the reading. <br />
For repeat readings, turn the large dial knob at least one full turn to the left, then dial it back&nbsp; in until you just &quot;kiss&quot; the black dot from coming back in from the left.<br />
Do this 3 times total.<br />
<br />
The first reading should be done on the dock just about amidships, pretty even with where the gravimeter is mounted on the ship (like right below the chem van).<br />
Remember to take a GPS and get GPS coordinates of your along-ship site.<br />
<br />
Remember to lock the small silver knob all the way to the right before moving to the &quot;known&quot; gravity station benchmark. <br />
<br />
Repeat steps above at the &quot;known&quot; gravity benchmark. Get GPS coordinates here also. Should match the existing paperwork if you are in the right spot (sometimes a little off though).<br />
<br />
Repeat steps above again at the along-ship location.<br />
<br />
