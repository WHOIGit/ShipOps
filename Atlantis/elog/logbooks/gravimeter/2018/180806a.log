========================================
<p>On Saturday, Aug. 4, 2018, the engineering department was required to shut off all ship&#39;s power except for the emergency generator.&nbsp; JT ran an extension cord up to teh gravimeter for me (going to the emergency power) so we would not risk losing power to the gravimeter.&nbsp; I shut everything else down (ship&#39;s servers, etc.).&nbsp; This seemed to work - providing continuous power to the system.&nbsp; However, since the two power switches (1. unplug gravimeter and plug into emergency power&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. unplug from emergency power and back into the regular ship&#39;s UPS provided power) we have been getting a red &quot;DNV&quot; light on the BGM-3 Interface unit.&nbsp; All the other deck boxes /electronics look fine, but the data on the software are bad.&nbsp; I tried recycling the power on the whole system several times.&nbsp; This worked temporarily.&nbsp; I also emailed.</p>

<p>Randy Herr suggested I try resetting just the BGM-3 box.&nbsp; The reset button did not do anything.&nbsp; So, I pulled out the rack and cycled the power from the backside.&nbsp; That was about 1 hour ago now and it is still good.&nbsp; I have requested assistance from the gravimeter group (come and check it out).</p>
