========================================
<p>The pitch gyro finally went out on 2018-Aug-13.&nbsp; Tom Lanagan and Steve came to the ship to check the malfunction lights and voltages.&nbsp; Tom replaced the gyro and ran the tilt tests.&nbsp; He also noted that teh entire box containing the gyros was not on it&#39;s &quot;floating pedestal&quot;.&nbsp; It has probably been that way since installed, since I do not believe we have ever had cause to open the lid.</p>
