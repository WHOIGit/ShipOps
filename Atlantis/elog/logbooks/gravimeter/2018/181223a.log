========================================
<p>On 2018-Dec-20 Emily Shimada, Dan Fornari and myself removed the gravimeter sensor in preparation for moving it to Scripps where it could be more carefully monitored during the Atlantis upcoming shipyard period.&nbsp; The desire was to be able to provide a consistent, &quot;good&quot; power supply to the system, have someone checking it on a fairly regular basis, and also having it on a UPS that could be accessed for monitoring via the internet.</p>

<p>Randy Herr&#39;s directions for sensor removal were followed.&nbsp; We had all three power supplies (AC, aux battery &amp; small battery pack).&nbsp; We also had Tom Lannigan on video chat with us to confirm / verify steps.&nbsp; During the removal, each time a step involved unplugging a power source, we monitored the &quot;Elex V&quot; and &quot;Bat V&quot; (where applicable) to make sure those values stayed within range.&nbsp; We did observe some drops to 25 V on the &quot;Elex V&quot; during &quot;unplugged&quot; periods.&nbsp; That value always returned immediately to 29 V when plugged back in).</p>

<p>Before sensor removal, the gravimeter rack UPS had one AC power supply and the Auxillary Battery Pack / Drawer had an AC power supply (from a separate source).&nbsp; Everything else requiring power was sourced through the gravimeter rack UPS.&nbsp; The two AC power sources were clean power and the SSSG UPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pieces of the system that were transported to Scripps were:&nbsp; the sensor electronics unit, the sensor and cabling, the small gray battery box, the Auxillary Battery drawer, and the UPS.&nbsp; The pieces that remained on the ship are:&nbsp; the rack, the BGM buffer unit, the laptop, and the gimbal&#39;ed stand w/gyros.</p>

<p>We did not have a transit bracket for the transit to Scripps.&nbsp; Therefore, the 3 allen socket screws that hold the sensor in the stand were left screwed into teh stand here on the ship.&nbsp; The sensor was carefully placed on a piece of styrofoam.&nbsp; The stack of:&nbsp; auxillary battery drawer, UPS, sensor electronics unit, and sensor w/cabling were strapped to a four wheel cart.&nbsp; This was rolled (carefully) out to the gangway (main lab aft watertight door was open).&nbsp; The cart was placed at the center of a pallet, with the wheels between slats and the whole thing was craned off the ship.&nbsp; Cart and all was secured into the back of an SUV and driven to Scripps.&nbsp; At one point the cart did roll toward one side (should have secured better from side to side rolling by wedging it in with something) - but no cables were pinched and we were able to recenter the cart for the rest of the ride.</p>
