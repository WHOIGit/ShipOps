========================================
<p>The science elog is being kept on:</p>
<p>http://r2rat01:8090</p>
<p>r2rat01 has the ip address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.11.241</p>
<p>In order close it out at the end of a cruise:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; go to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://r2rat01:8090/{cruise ID}-SE/?cmd=ecfmhome</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; go through the steps of download and archive</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; copy the csv over to the data directory via linus:/tmp/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data are in r2root@r2rat01://shipdata/<cite>{cruise id}</cite></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><cite>AFTER THE CRUISE IS OVER ____</cite></p>
<p><cite>If you all are using the R2R Eventlog during the cruise, and after the endCruise event has been entered (or<br />
whenever science is done), if you all could rsync the data to /home/data/r2r and download and copy the tar<br />
files to /home/data/r2r/proc (I think you will need to make that directory), that would be great.<br />
<br />
These commands should work on the Alucia:<br />
<br />
rsync -av r2root@192.168.11.241:/shipdata/[cruiseid]/r2r/* /home/data/r2r/.<br />
<br />
After you click &quot;end event logging&quot; you will get a screen that has two buttons:<br />
Download Archive File<br />
Download CSV<br />
<br />
This will download two tgz files, one of the directory structure and one w/ the all the events in csv<br />
format, which can than be brought into a spread sheet. They will download to your computer and can be copied<br />
over to /home/data/r2r/proc.<br />
