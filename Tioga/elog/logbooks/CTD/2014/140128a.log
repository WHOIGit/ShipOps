========================================
<p>an and Ken,<br />
The SBE9 s/n 0484 has been setup and configured with newly calibrated SBE3, 4 and 43<br />
sensors.<br />
I've attached an RAR file for you, and am bringing a thumb drive for use you offload the<br />
same data when we bring the SBE9.<br />
<br />
The SBE9 pressure channel was calibrated at SBE in March 2013 and not used since it was<br />
shipped here.<br />
The .RAR file contains all necessary files (XML for each sensor, and PDFs where<br />
available), including a PSA file to start the SeaSave.<br />
It also contains appnotes for the particular sensors installed.<br />
<br />
Con files are saved as .XMLCON format.<br />
You'll have to change the .XMLCON to:<br />
- set the proper RS232 port used for the:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; SBE9 data,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - for the SBE32 pylon comms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - and for how you acquire NMEA (deck unit or PC, and then for the PC port).<br />
- set the XMLCON to show you have the pylon installed. It is not set now.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have questions.<br />
Regards, Marshall<br />
