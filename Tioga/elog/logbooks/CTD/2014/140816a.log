========================================
<p>&nbsp;Ken and Ian,</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The stainless rosette which you will use on Tioga is ready for pickup in the Clark Highbay.</div>
<div>Dave Wellwood and I serviced the rosette and CTD and confirmed it is ok to use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What we did:</div>
<div>- recently calibrated primary SBE3 and SBE4 sensors were installed.</div>
<div>- new cables were installed for both primary sensors.</div>
<div>- a recently calibrated SBE43 oxygen sensor and new cable were installed.</div>
<div>- the WETLabs transmissometer was installed.</div>
<div>- Dave checked out all bottles and o-rings.</div>
<div>- All connectors were inspected and properly reseated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- A new zip file was created, attached to this email, containing all the relevant .XML, .PDF,</div>
<div>XMLCON and PSAREPORT.txt files for this configuration. See file &quot;Tioga2014.zip&quot;.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- The pylon and all sensors were confirmed working and reading as expected using our SBE11</div>
<div>deckunit and SeaSave ver 7.23.2 on Win7-64 with the newly created XMLCON file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The XMLCON that I have sent must be changed for your particular setup in the following ways,</div>
<div>at</div>
<div>least:</div>
<div>- modify the file path definitions for your own PC for data, .PSA, and all relevant file</div>
<div>paths.</div>
<div>- change the serial ports for CTD and MODEM data for your own PC.</div>
<div>- change the .PSA to incorporate GPS if you are using it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me know if you have any questions.</div>
<div>Good luck on the next series of cruises.</div>
