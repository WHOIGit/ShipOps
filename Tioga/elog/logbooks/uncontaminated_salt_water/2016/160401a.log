========================================
<p>Found out the reason that the SBE48 was not working was because it was unplugged.&nbsp; There is a plug in the aft, stbd corner in the lab, somehow it got pulled apart.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Prior to finding that I had a ton of trouble talking to the SBE48, it kept spitting out garbage.&nbsp; Tried a different one and it work, so it's not the wiring.&nbsp; Brought the old one up to the office, it worked there.&nbsp; Put it back, now it works.&nbsp; WTF?!</p>
