========================================
<p>the fluorometer data was intermittent for the last&nbsp; 3 weeks.&nbsp; It worked  and then it did not, checked power to connector, fluorometer was getting  power (14 volts)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I removed it, I plumbed directly to the SBE45. I turned on the valves<br />
and it looks ok. I put the fluorometer cable in a baggie and tapped it up<br />
out of the way. I have the tubbing and the bottom fitting up in my office<br />
to the left of my monitor. The fitting sort of looks broken. <br />
