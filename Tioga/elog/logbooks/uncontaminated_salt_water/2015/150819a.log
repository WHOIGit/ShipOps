========================================
<p>Removed the flurometer, cleaned it, and checked it by itself.&nbsp; Did the check where one inserts a white zip tie, the flurometer is definitely working.&nbsp; Voltage went up/down with zip tie in/out, this was recorded by dsLog.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Removed and &quot;cleaned&quot; all the plumbing.&nbsp; Clean might not be quite the right word, but it's better.&nbsp; It also seems likely that the small quick disconnect fitting was clogged, or possibly something else in the system.&nbsp; A lot of junk came out.&nbsp; I removed the quick disconnect, it seemed kind of clogged beyond repair.&nbsp; Re-assembled everyting, but did not test it, as I don't know how to get the sea water pump running.&nbsp;&nbsp; I left all the valves shut, system is dry.&nbsp; </p>
