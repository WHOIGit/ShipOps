========================================
<p>Salt water not working, determined it to be the pump and not a full strainer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Found that one of the pump shaft bearing supports had sort of sheared off.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had to guess, I'd say the pump was run dry for an extended period of time, hours or more.&nbsp; Replaced the pump bearing housing and all is well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tested, all seems well.</p>
<p>Note, there is another separate plumbing issue that limits use of the pump, this other repair is being done by the shop.&nbsp; </p>
