========================================
<p>Installed SBE48 on Tioga, ship did not have one before.&nbsp; Presently it's installed below the settee, fwd of the galley.&nbsp;&nbsp; Install date is May 27, 2013.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some touch up / follow work may be needed.&nbsp; Better routing for the data cable should be found, but since this may involve removing the overhead, it did not happen at this time.&nbsp; A better clamp should be made to press the sensor against the hull.&nbsp; Probably an aluminium sacrificial disc should be made, to place between the copper disk on the sensor, and the aluminium hull.</p>
