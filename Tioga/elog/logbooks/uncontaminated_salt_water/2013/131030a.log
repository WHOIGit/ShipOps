I believe I have the answer, and it's not pretty.&nbsp; It looks like the valve that feeds the SBE45 and flurometer<br />
is shut, and has been for an extended time.<br />
<br />
When I went to look at the flurometer on Thursday, I found the valves for both the feed water and the discharge<br />
were shut.&nbsp; (and that the flurometer itself had no problems)&nbsp; After talking to Ken and Ian, we are all sure that<br />
no one has been open/closing the valves on a per trip basis, so I can only assume that they have been closed for<br />
a long time.<br />
<br />
The 132 millivolt number you have been seeing is what the instrument puts out when it's dry.&nbsp; I'm a bit puzzled<br />
at to how the flurometer could go from wet to dry over a 1 minute period, but that seems to be what happened.<br />
<br />
The flurometer and the SBE45 temp/cond sensor are in series with each other.&nbsp; It should be possible to look at<br />
the SBE45 and determine when the system was last running properly.&nbsp; I did try to do this, but it's hard to do<br />
this while just looking columns of numbers, I really need to graph it.&nbsp; Especially in the summer, when the<br />
numbers don't change that much anyway.&nbsp; (the water is 20c, the boat is 20c)<br />
<br />
I don't really know what to say, this totally sucks and I'm sorry it happened.&nbsp; Ken said he would put up a<br />
checklist, although at this point, I don't think anyone will forget this anymore.<br />

&gt; The jump took place between 2 adjacent samples, 1 minute apart-- see attached.&nbsp; Valery checked the pump status<br />
&gt; and it was on the entire time.<br />

&gt; &gt; Hi Dennis<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; That is a pretty good step.&nbsp; Do you know if that happened over a single<br />
&gt; &gt; data point and/or how much time it was?&nbsp; The data is plotted against<br />
&gt; &gt; longitude, which is time (sort of) if the ship was moving, but I don't<br />
&gt; &gt; want to assume too much.&nbsp; It does not look like the instrument failed<br />
&gt; &gt; completely, but I'm not certain.&nbsp; That -could- be a failure mode.&nbsp; It<br />
&gt; &gt; also does look like if could be a water mass change, but the step seems<br />
&gt; &gt; to sudden for that.&nbsp; But Tioga is fast, if those are 1 minute intervals,<br />
&gt; &gt; that's a 1/4 mile or more.<br />
&gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; I need to look at some of the data since then.<br />
