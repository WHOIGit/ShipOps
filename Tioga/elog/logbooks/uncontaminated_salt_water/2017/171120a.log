========================================
<p>SBE48 not putting out data, unable to talk to it with minicom from datalog computer.&nbsp; Removed for testing in office.&nbsp; No issues found, other than low battery.&nbsp; Replaced battery, all working perfectly on the bench.&nbsp; Reinstalled in the ship, still unable to talk to it with minicom.&nbsp; No data at this time since the startnow command has not been issued.</p>
<p>Update, looked at system while on the ship.&nbsp; It appears that serial port 4 is bad.&nbsp; Move to serial port 0, where it seemed to work fine.&nbsp; Worked for a while, but then it stopped.&nbsp; No reason.&nbsp; Logged in remotely, unable to talk to it via minicom.&nbsp; Rebooted computer and was able to use minicom to talk to SBE48.&nbsp; However, seems to be some noise on the line.&nbsp; Restarted, seems to be mostly ok, but still some noise.&nbsp; Restarted dslog, waiting.</p>
