========================================
<p>The SBE48 sensor was located under the settee in the galley of the ship. The sensor was reading significantly different temperatures than the SBE45 also on the ship. We hypothesize that the sensor is resting close to the top/above the water line and therefore not collecting accurate data. As a fix, I moved the sensor down a &quot;compartment&quot; against the hull to see if this would make any difference. Pictures attached show where the sensor was located previously..</p>

<p>Further fix would be to remove the sensor or find a better location..</p>
