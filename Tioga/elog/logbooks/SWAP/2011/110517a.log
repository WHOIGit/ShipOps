========================================
<p>The port antenna cable has a serious ding in it, probably letting in lots of water.&nbsp; The starboard cable has a smaller ding.&nbsp; Looks like it might have happened when the paint was removed in the shipyard.&nbsp; Port needs to be replaced, starboard probably does.</p>
