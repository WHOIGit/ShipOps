========================================
<p>Extensive NMEA 2000 network added to the ship, add NGW-1 to get data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>NMEA 2000 devices added to the ship recently:<br />
GPS, Radar, Depth Sounder, Chart Plotter, GPS based Compass, Flux Gate Compass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This device, an Actisense NGW-1-ISO can transfer NMEA data between NMEA 2000 and NMEA 0183.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are only using it to pick up NMEA 2000 data and convert it to NMEA0183.</p>
