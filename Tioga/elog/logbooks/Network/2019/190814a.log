========================================
no ip sla 1
>   icmp-echo 128.128.200.1 source-interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
>   threshold 500
>   timeout 500
>   frequency 1

no ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now

above that is this line that labels "track 1" as using "sla 1"

no track 1 ip sla 1 reachability
Then between the track definition and the sla definition (again, not overly intuitive) there is a static route:

no ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 128.128.200.1 track 1

The route appears and disappears as track 1 changes (you can use "show ip route" to watch it come and go)

further down in the config is the event:

event manager applet CLEAR_NAT_ON_REACHABILITY
>  event track 1 state any
>  action 1.0 syslog msg "Clearing NAT on reachability change"
>  action 2.0 cli command "enable"
>  action 3.0 cli command "clear ip nat translation forced"

no ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 GigabitEthernet0/0/1 112


Added OSPF stuff
