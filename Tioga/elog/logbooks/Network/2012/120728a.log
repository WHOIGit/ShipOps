Jim Avery and I went down to the dock after lunch and had a look at the<br />
Tioga's pedestal. The shackjack had been 'weather proofed' and the tioga<br />
jack (the ethernet port on the black board) is now working. I plugged it<br />
into the Tioga's cisco router and it started routing using OSPF.<br />
<br />
I labeled the 'jacks' in the pedestal with where they go and what their gw<br />
is..<br />
<br />
Thanks, laura<br />

I was down on the dock checking out the tioga dock connection at 0630<br />
this morning.. I am not sure what was done, according to the ticket a<br />
'jack' was replaced, but I think it was the wrong one.<br />
<br />
In the tioga pedestal there are 2 ethernet jacks.<br />
<br />
One was in a 'black' jack, but at some point was removed and was replaced<br />
by a &quot;punch down ethernet jack that was plugged directly into a red RS485<br />
cable that goes to the guardshack that was wrapped up with electrical tape<br />
and shoved up behind the black board&quot;. This one worked when this ticket<br />
was first opened. When a netbook was plugged into it an ip address of<br />
128.128.95.201 was obtained.<br />
<br />
The second ethernet jack is part of the black board in the pedestal,<br />
this one did not work and still does not work. When a netbook is plugged<br />
into a dock ethernet port that does work it gets and ip address of:<br />
128.128.200.29<br />
<br />
The two ethernet jacks go to two different subnets. Since the Knorr is<br />
arriving tomorrow at 0900 hrs I have plugged the guard shack back into the<br />
totally exposed copper wired jack that is resting on the ground. They<br />
need it for their phone lines.<br />
<br />
Can we change this ticket from Medium to Urgent? The Tioga should be<br />
in today and I can be available to help. Some labeling of the Jacks would<br />
be helpful as well. Weather proofing of the Shack Jack would also be good.<br />
The exposed copper wires on the dock will not last too long..<br />

Looking back in the logs, the last time the Tioga was seen on the<br />
switch, Bigelow Ground, was on Jun 23rd. The port was Gi 1/0/20. I think<br />
that June 23 was the day that the switch died. I went in and replaced<br />
the switch the next day. It's possible I may have gotten some wires<br />
crossed when I replaced the switch. The MAC address for Tioga was last<br />
seen on the SMC PoE switch which may be due to someone connecting the<br />
Tioga to a different jack elsewhere. Or it may be that the Tioga jack is<br />
wired to the SMC (instead of the Cisco). At any rate, the Tioga should<br />
be connected to port 20 on switch 1.<br />
<br />
Matt, can you verify that the cable from the Tioga is connected to port<br />
1/0/20 (Switch 1 is the one with 4 fiber ports)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Nope still not working.. The interface shows up, but it is plugged into a<br />
netgear switch. I tried using a static route to 128.128.200.1 and traffic<br />
does not route...<br />

Curious how things were going, I have not heard anything in the last week,<br />
the tioga router is not getting an ospf message and unable to route out<br />
the tioga pedestal. Are there any other tests I can run? Both the Knorr<br />
(next week) and Atlantis will be in soon and will need access to shore via<br />
the dock, not sure if the issue is just with the tioga's pedestal or w/<br />
the dock in general... laura<br />

I plugged the tioga LAN into the other port on the pedestal (it had gone<br />
to the guard shack). I am able to get an ip number (128.128.95.218) on a<br />
netbook. The tioga router says it is up (protocol up), but it is not<br />
getting an ospf message and thus not routing out the dock.<br />
<br />
here is some information from the tioga's router:<br />

Hi..<br />
<br />
The dock pedestal that the Tioga uses for internet appears not to be<br />
working. I plugged a netbook directly in using a different ethernet cable<br />
and was unable to get a ipnumber, there did not seem to be any<br />
connectivity. I was wondering if someone could come down and have a look.<br />
<br />
Thanks, laura<br />
