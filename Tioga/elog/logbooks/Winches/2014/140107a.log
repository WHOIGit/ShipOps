========================================
<p>Reterminated .322 wire using poured socket with Cerrobend.&nbsp; No problems.&nbsp; Reterminated electrical portion using shrink wrapped soldered connections and 3M potting compound.&nbsp; No problems</p>
<p>still needs weight test.&nbsp; (ship will do this, 2000lb weight is on hand?)&nbsp; Should be meggared.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Original ground was unusual, in that the ground wire went into the poured socket, not sure how it terminated in there.&nbsp; Present ground is on a screw on outside of termination.&nbsp; (the &quot;normal&quot; way.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Socket used is slightly different in that it has a slot for the electrical wire, instead of a hole.&nbsp; Not entirely sure what I think of this.&nbsp; It's quite a bit harder to seal the slot against the Cerrobend, though not really difficult.&nbsp; </p>
