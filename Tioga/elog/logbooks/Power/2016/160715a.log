========================================
<p>Load tested UPS by pulling plug, system immediately went down.&nbsp; Replaced batteries, all seems well.&nbsp; Tested for 20 minutes, UPS still indicated another 10 minutes available.</p>
<p>Also cleaned out UPS vents, as they were 100% clogged up with dust.</p>
