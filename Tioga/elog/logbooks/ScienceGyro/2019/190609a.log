========================================
<p>Replaced the batteries in Furuno GPS base heading device.&nbsp;&nbsp; (one battery is in the control box, one is in the display head.)</p>

<p>Also, read the instructions before re-installing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This system has been very seriously mis-installed for many years, possibly forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a configuration setting that must be set to tell the system how the control box is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was set to &quot;deck mount&quot;, which was wrong for the location that it was in prior to the spring 2019 shipyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now deck mounted, and set for &quot;deck mount, position A&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; (read the manual)&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is also an internal setting in the control box that also has to match.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three rate gyros inside the control box.&nbsp;&nbsp; These must be physically moved to the correct location.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (deck mount or bulkhead mount)&nbsp;&nbsp; They were in bulkhead mount, (wrong for the present location), now they are in deck mount, which is correct for the present location.</p>

<p>So, prior to the shipyard, the gyros were mounted correctly, but the system was set up incorrectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the shipyard, the system was setup correctly, (pretty much by luck), but the gyros were no mounted correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, (june 9th, 2019), all appears to be correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system came up with a heading very quickly, which pretty much confirms that it was wrong before and is right now.</p>
