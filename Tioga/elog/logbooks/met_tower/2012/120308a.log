========================================
<p>Installed on Mast.. still need to finish Calliope setup for wind</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need height of mast to sea level for barometer..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need all the Metadata.. Need to update calliope's metadata..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** The Vaisala WXT520 is mounted and all of the cables are dressed and secured.<br />
Note that while the address for this WXT520 is &quot;P&quot; (port), it's on the stbd<br />
side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** I found the setting for the wind offset and set it to 185, (which is about&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
correct).&nbsp; Calliope may have an issue here.&nbsp; The relative wind did not change<br />
at all.&nbsp; So, assuming I put the entry in the correct location, calliope is<br />
applying this change somewhere further down the line, but it should be applied<br />
before this point.&nbsp; Or, we are displaying raw relative, not ship relative.</p>
