========================================
<p>Went on board to look at UPS, found the pilot house to be 91 degrees near the deck.&nbsp; Rack has to be well over 100.&nbsp; AC fan was on, but not the compresser.&nbsp; Turned on AC, seems to be working.&nbsp; Filter was quite dirty, cleaned it, but I don't think that this was not the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is an ongoing problem, we need to deal with this somehow.</p>
