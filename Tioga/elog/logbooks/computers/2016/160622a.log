========================================
<p>Laura cannot find some of the data.</p>
<p>Check the UPS, it's functional, did not test for an extended time period</p>
<p>FTP was not responding to the keyboard, rebooted it.&nbsp; this fixed it, but then the usb plug came out, now no keyboard again.&nbsp; Might have been the problem the first time.</p>
<p>tidatalog was off, turned it on.&nbsp; it appears to have stopped collecting data yesterday around 1110 gmt.</p>
<p>Turned on the airconditioning, as it was about 80 in the pilothouse.</p>
