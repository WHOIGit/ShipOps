There is no power when we're off the boat. Either the shore power cable or receptacle is acting up so<br />
until I can get an electrician aboard we're on generator power while aboard&nbsp; and it's lights out when<br />
we're not. <br />
<br />
Things will get fired up tomorrow starting around 07:00 and we'll get underway at around 08:00. Hopefully<br />
I can get things squared away on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

&gt; Hi Ken..<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; It is sunday morning and I tried to access the tioga again, but cannot get there via SWAP or the dock.<br />
Is there power? I wonder if the router got caught in some wierd state.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; What time is your cruise on Monday? It would be helpful if I could get to the ship to backup the data<br />
before your next cruise.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Thanks, laura<br />

&gt;&gt; New issue. We're having issues with our shore power and it'll be Monday before we can address them. It<br />
was fine yesterday morning but when we came back in the afternoon something had changed and of course<br />
being a Friday afternoon...<br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt; I'll get everything back up and running in about three hours or so before todays trip but then we'll<br />
be underway for the day.<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ken..<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you plug in the shore? I don't see the ship on SWAP either..<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is the ship really at the WHOI dock?<br />
