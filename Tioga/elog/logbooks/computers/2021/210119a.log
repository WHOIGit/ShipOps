========================================
<p>The USB to serial for datalog died about the time the crew was looking under the sink to see what needed to be done to swap out the SBE45. I swapped over to the ADCP USB2SERIAL and used the old Tioga USB2SERIAL for the ADCP. It seems to be working ok, but will have Rick order up some new ones.</p>
