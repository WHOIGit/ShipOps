========================================
<p>ADCP would not fire up.&nbsp; Found bad power supply, replace with new, bigger (400w), slightly larger one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After new power supply, computer ran fine, but com port card vanished.&nbsp; Removed other, old bogus virtual com ports, com card showed up.&nbsp; Then went away again.&nbsp; Reseated cards and all is now well.</p>
