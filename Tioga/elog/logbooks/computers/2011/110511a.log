========================================
<p>Installed ntp for windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Version installed: <b>NTP 4.2.4p8, </b>obtained from http://www.meinberg.de/download/ntp/windows/ntp-4.2.4p8@lennon-o-lpv-win32-setup.exe<b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Initial setup did not work correctly and the service would not start.&nbsp; This was because ntp failed to stop and disable tardis.&nbsp; ntp did manage to disable K9 and windows time service.&nbsp; Manually stopped and disabled tardis, all is well.</p>
