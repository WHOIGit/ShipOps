========================================
<p>&nbsp;Hi Ken and Ian..</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just a couple of notes. I went over most of this with Ian, but thought I</div>
<div>would type it up, let me know if I missed something :)..</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. There is an instance of ELOG on the ftp computer..</div>
<div>From the science/wireless network:</div>
<div>http://192.168.11.1:8080</div>
<div>From WHOI or using a VPN from outside WHOI:</div>
<div>http://dockti.whoi.edu:8080</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have tried to use it to keep track of what gets done on the ship.</div>
<div>Marshall made an entry when he re-terminated the seacable. Let me know if</div>
<div>there is something you would like me to add, or change or ...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. The data can be accessed via the website or by mounting it via samba. I</div>
<div>have it mounted on the science computer as drive z:</div>
<div>Ian was able to mount it on his laptop using.. find computer on network:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>\\192.168.11.1\data</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Cindy and I put a dreamplug on the ship's network.</div>
<div>This computer hosts the R2R Science Eventlog. To access it:</div>
<div>http://192.168.11.241:8090</div>
<div>This is the Eventlog that Gareth Lawson talked to Ken about. It is setup</div>
<div>for this next cruise: ti708</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To enter an event click on the &quot;Show Eventlog&quot; tab.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To go from one cruise to the next, it is currently at the point where you</div>
<div>can add instruments or participants:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>*Configure ELOG w/ Instruments and Participants</div>
<div>*SUBMIT FINAL PRECRUISE CONFIGURATION</div>
<div>*Log events by clicking on &quot;Show Eventlog&quot; tab</div>
<div>*END EVENT LOGGING</div>
<div>&nbsp; Download csv file and tar file</div>
<div>*END CRUISE</div>
<div>*OK</div>
<div>* Time to start the newcruise</div>
<div>*USE DEFAULT TEMPLATE</div>
<div>*Enter CruiseID</div>
<div>*click &quot;Create New Cruise&quot;</div>
<div>*Back to the top to Configure ELOG w/ Instruments and Participants</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. The ADCP is back in and now uses UHDAS to collect data. To view or</div>
<div>get the ADCP data from a windoze machine, search for computer on network:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>\\192.168.4.7\cruise</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It still needs to be calibrated. I forwarded Frank's suggestions in a</div>
<div>separate email. Basically if you all could do a bunch of maneuvering in</div>
<div>shallowish water w/ bottom track on, going no more than 10 knots..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. I was wondering if you could add some extra information to the cruise</div>
<div>email and/or pdf?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>ScienceSalt water pump: on/off valves: open/closed</div>
<div>ADCP: on/off</div>
<div>Knudsen: on/off</div>
<div>CTD: yes/no</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be a big help, when gathering up data..</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks, laura</div>
