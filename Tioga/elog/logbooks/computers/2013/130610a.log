========================================
<p>Unable to log into ftp from away.&nbsp; As it turns out also unable to log in locally. &nbsp; I could get to the login, (locally), but it would never give me a chance  to type the password.&nbsp; I'm guessing some process had run away.&nbsp; Rebooted to fix.</p>
