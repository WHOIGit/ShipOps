========================================
<p>the more worrying part, of course, is how stable that serial acquisition is. If it was just a &quot;bad USB0&quot;,<br />
that would be great (we are now on USB4)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the shore-email list already has me and eric and dropbox@rvdata<br />
so leave those there.&nbsp; Will the ship be able to send email when it's sailing?&nbsp;&nbsp; if so, make the cron send<br />
email at (say) 1pm local, to have the highest odds that they are at sea.&nbsp; If the ship only sends email<br />
when they are at the pier, maybe we could have this be the protocol:<br />
<br />
- come in and tie up<br />
- get the internet on line<br />
- type this to send an email<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daily.py --use_defaults<br />
- stop logging<br />
- end cruise<br />
<br />
<br />
I can ask Eric if he's willing for &quot;end cruise&quot; to<br />
actually send an email too, perhaps only &quot;if configured to do so&quot;.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Is there any backdoor mechanism to start and stop UHDAS from the backdoor.</p>
