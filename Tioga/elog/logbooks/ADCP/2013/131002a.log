========================================
<p>Robbie replaced bulkhead connector on ADCP</p>
<p>Craig Marquette tested system.. .txt attached</p>
<p>Ian Hanley replaced ADCP on ship, beam 45 degrees to port.. attached drawing of installation</p>
<p>&nbsp;Found ADCP with damaged connector and plug.&nbsp; No particular fault found, probably just water<br />
leakage, followed by electrolytic corrosion destroying the connector.&nbsp; No water intrusion<br />
into the ADCP proper.&nbsp; Obtained kit from RDI to replace the connector, also pigtail to<br />
replace the end of the cable.<br />
<br />
Work done.<br />
1- Thorough cleaning with vinegar.<br />
2- Replaced the underwater connector on the underwater unit, new &quot;O&quot; rings, replaced the<br />
desiccant with new.<br />
3- Removed damaged underwater connector on cable, cut back cable until reached cable in<br />
good condition.&nbsp; (cable was wet inside.)&nbsp; Spliced new underwater pigtail and connector onto<br />
the the good end of the existing cable.&nbsp; Pigtail is about 20' long.&nbsp; Splice is good, but<br />
not intended for underwater use.&nbsp; (which should not matter in this application, as only<br />
about 4' of cable will be in the water.)<br />
