========================================
<p>The CTD computer, which runs the Knudsen software, was saying &quot;no sounder found&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeated reboots of both the Knudsen and the CTD computer did not fix this, even though the reboots were carried out in the right order.&nbsp; (knudsen powered up first, then the computer)</p>
<p>Removed the Knudsen from the rack to check for power.&nbsp; System is getting power.&nbsp; Also pushed a small button on the knudsen control board, no idea what this does, but pushed it anyway.&nbsp; Reassembled the system.&nbsp; (reseated all external connections)&nbsp; Power up the Knudsen, then the CTD computer.&nbsp; Now it works................&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>While the Knudsen is working, the depth data is not showing up on the status screen.&nbsp; </p>

========================================
<p>Troubleshooting the lack of a depth display on the status screen.&nbsp; Found a number of issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; First problem was bad cable from the Knudsen to the USB port on dsLog. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fixed.&nbsp; 2nd problem was wrong baud rate in the knudsen serial setup. Fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So now good data is being recorded in the raw files for dsLog. However, still no data for the status display.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad parsing?</p>
