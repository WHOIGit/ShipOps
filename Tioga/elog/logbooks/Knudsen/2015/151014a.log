========================================
<p>The CTD/Knudsen PC is attached to the Knudsen Deckunit via a Belkin SCSI USB Adapter. Windoze 2000 needs the EUSBSCSI.SYS driver for the USBSCSI Adapter F5U115-UNV.</p>
<p>I copied the driver and it other pieces and parts to the CTD/Knudsen computer c:\belkin_something or other. </p>
<p>I was able to reboot the computer and have the Echo Control software come up working. I can ping and see the bottom at the dock, not getting a very good reading, but it seems to be working ok. It turns out the the ECHO software is sending data out at 19200 8N1, so fixed tidatalog. </p>
