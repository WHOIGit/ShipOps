========================================
<p>Spring 2019 shipyard.</p>

<p>We have decided to remove the Knudsen from the ship, due to it being obsolete, not being used much, and the difficulty of the SCSI connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; The transducers have been left in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time there is no scientific depth sounder and no plans to replace it.&nbsp; The ships sounder will be used to collect the water depth.</p>
